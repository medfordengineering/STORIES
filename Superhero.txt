SUPERHERO

"Could you at least put a towel on?" "I have a towel on." "I am not talking
about your head." "Don't be such a prude. Man's body is beautiful. At least
mine is." 

Adam Persopolis lay on his stomach on a plush pile rug. And it was true,
his body was beautiful. Resting on his forearms he read the Saturday
morning paper.  Clay stood behind him trying to decide if he should just
leave. It was a thought that periodically ran through his head and involved
a not so elaborate scenario about where he would go, but he never left. 

"Look at this." Adam said as he continued reading the paper. "Layton
Properties is buying another building in the square. It's the one on Bow
St." "Not the old Clark Building?" asked Clay who had turned away from Adam
to pour himself some coffee at the kitchen counter. "Yup. That's the one."
Clay put down his cup down and sighed. "Well there goes Stacy's Tavern and
the Bow St. Book Shop." "Yeah, they've kept the theater vacant for years."

Clay turned and sat at the kitchen table and tried unsuccessfully to not
look at Adam's backside.  "What do you say we head down to Stacy's for
lunch and see what is up with this Layton thing?" asked Adam.  "As long as
you put some clothes on." Clay said through the steam rising off his cup of
coffee. "Well if you insist.  But I'll just be depriving the public." Adam
smiled to no one as his face was hidden from Clay's view.

Adam and Clay had known each other since high school and had lived together
since they were in their twenties. Their home was a small and nondescript
brick building in a lonely section of the city set among other small and
nondescript brick buildings. The original purpose of their building was
unclear but over the past century it had housed a variety of small industry
that had come into and gone out of fashion, the last one being typewriter
sales and repair.

They lived primarily on the second of two floors. The space was open and
light with one large area for kitchen, dining and living each delineated by
a couch, chairs or a table. Clay had purchased or collected most of the
furnishings and had directed the renovation from what had once been dark
and crowded office space.

A little after noon, Adam and Clay sat across a marbled Formica table in a
tall backed and dimly lit booth. Stephanie, a woman who looked to be well
into her seventies approached to take their order. A small paper hat sat
neatly on a wavy pile of well coiffed white hair. She wore a light pink
uniform with starched white collar and cuffs and had a clean pleated white
apron tied about her waist. It was a uniform she had worn for years and she
still filled it well. But as she stood at their table she stooped slightly,
as if to suggest a change in trajectory.

She had worked at the tavern since Adam and Clay were in their teens and
probably long before. Recognizing them she gave them a hearty "Hi fellas"
adding that she had not seen them for a couple of weeks. She took their
orders with the same professional competence that she had always shown, but
the rhythm of her performance was slightly stilted giving a sense that she
had begun relying more on patterns of habit than inspiration to get through
the day.

Adam noticed her counterpart, a boy still in college and doing his homework
at the bar between waiting on tables. Behind the bar was Francis, who had
owned the tavern for the past fifteen years and had worked there for ten
years before that. Seeing Adam, he came out from behind the bar where he
still worked serving drinks seven days a week.  As he approached he wiped
his hands on an apron that looked dirty enough to make the act a zero sum
affair. In his late fifties, he combed his thin hair over a bald pate.  He
sat down heavily in the booth next to Clay and when asked how things were
going gave his usual answer sighing "Well, I seem to be breaking even." But
there was nothing in his manner or the tavern to suggest that he aspired to
anything more. 

"I hear that Layton Properties is buying the building." Adam said. "Yeah, I
heard that as well. I got nothing against them. Doesn't matter too much to
me who I pay the rent check to." "But what if they ask for more rent?"
asked Clay. "How can they?" responded Francis. "There is no way I can
afford to pay any more than I do. Like trying to get blood from a stone."
He laughed.  Francis really seemed to believe in his logic and Adam and
Clay did not have the heart to enlighten him.

Francis returned to the bar. Adam stared off quietly into the tavern
holding a martini poised above the table in his heavy almost muscular
hands. Hands that looked like they had been forged from years of labor. The
sort of hands that Clay's own father had come by honestly, but here they
were on Adam who spent his days typing stories for a local magazine. Clay
admired them, clean and manicured and tucked gently into starched white
cuffs wrapped in fine tweed sleeves. Clay's own hands were long and thin
like his mother's.

Leaving the tavern they walked down the street to the news stand. Greeting
Angelo, the owner, Adam asked if he had heard about Layton's plans for the
Clark Building. Angelo said he had and figured his own days were numbered
as well. "It would not be long before Layton owned every building in the
square" he said adding, "It's just like he is doing with Eastside." Adam
and Clay had both heard rumours about the city's plans for Eastside, an
large section of the city area across the river. "I had heard the city was
buying properties there." said Clay. "Yes, but it is Layton that is behind
the whole plan and the city is not buying properties it is condemning
them." said Angelo "Once they condemn a property all of the rent starts
going to the city. The owner becomes desperate to sell and guess who picks
up the property at a bargain price."

"So if it is condemned how can they still be getting rent?" Clay asked.
"Yeah, good question." Angelo responded. "The whole thing is a scam. The
city claims that all of Eastside is a slum and needs to be torn down and
rebuilt with shiny new towers. But whose making all the money, Old Winnie
Layton.  And I am sure he is not the only one whose making a few bucks. If
there is a pot with money in it, you can be sure that Mayor Benny's got a
hand in that pot. I grew up there till I was ten and my father was born
there. It ain't no slum and never was."

Leaving the stand Adam and Clay, stood on the street corner caught in a
moment of mutual and unspoken indecision about what to do with the day.
Clay with the magazine he had purchased tucked under his arm, tried to
remember what they had done last weekend. Adam just yawned. The wind had
picked up. A seagull flew overhead, blown in from the shore. Its cry out of
place over the rumble of buses and honking horns.  When too much time had
passed, they agreed to head home.

On the next block they could see a line of construction workers slowly
marching in front of a construction site. Reaching the corner they stopped
to wait their turn to pass the marching workers on the narrowed sidewalk.
Next to them, a worker leaned against the wall, an unlit cigarette hung
from his mouth. He patted his pockets in search of a light.  "Hey buddy" he
addressed Adam, "got a match?" "Sure." Adam responded as he fetched a
silver lighter from his breast pocket and leaned over to light the man's
cigarette.

"What's up?" Adam nodded toward the men marching. "Last week one of the
guys got burned and now Mayfair Construction is refusing to pay his
hospital bills." he said between puffs of smoke. "The only reason he got
burned was from a worn out gas line on the welder which he told them needed
to be replaced. They been cutting corners since we started this project and
it was only a matter of time before someone got seriously hurt."

"Whose up there now?" asked Clay. "Scabs" he pointed with his cigarette.
"and I can tell you they have no idea what they are doing." Both Adam and
Clay turned their attention to the scabs who crawled about on the giant
skeleton of iron girders. As they watched, they heard the sound of
scaffolding which had been set on the third floor of the building give way.
They turned to see the broken scaffolding fall free of the building and
crash into the pavement below. The worker who had been standing on the
scaffolding fell against the open edge of third floor and then bounced over
the edge instinctively grabbing a rope that, by shear luck, held him
suspended three stories above the pavement.

Instantly, Adam was gone and there appeared leaping from one floor to the
next on the outside of the building, a man in a costume of grey and black
that fit tightly against his body. Reaching the third floor he pulled the
dangling worker up to safety. A crowd of scabs rushed to greet him. Down
below from where Clay stood, the striking workers pointed toward the man in
costume and said "Look its Superman!"

This was the name he had been given by the public and a direct reference to
the comic book hero with whom he shared some super human abilities. But he
was not born on a distant planet nor cast toward Earth moments before its
destruction. Adam was of the Earth and while there are many stories told of
his origin there is only one true story.

He was born the only son of Sarah and Mitchel Clydesdale in the rural
mining town of Havilah. Mitchel spent his days in the mines and his nights
in the local tavern where he drank till the pain that lived inside of him
could raise no more than a grumble. Sometimes he went home too early, short
of money and raised holy hell with Sarah who could match him drink for
drink and blow for blow. Their baby just lay in his crib and he cried all
day and he cried all night. 

On Sundays, Mitchel went out into the woods to hunt for deer, but shot just
about anything that had the misfortune to cross his path. Hunting was one
of the few things he did well, drunk or sober. One Sunday, a jaguar sat
hidden in rocky outcrop. The jaguar knew not to be out during daylight
hours, but his family was hungry and man left little in the land they
shared. As he waited, a deer came into view only 50 yards below. As he
inched forward into the open to prepare his attack, he suddenly saw a
hunter out of the corner of his eye. It was the sort of carelessness that
he typically attributed to man. Mitchel had seen the same deer and now he
saw the jaguar. He turned and shot. Leaping forward the jaguar caught the
bullet in his hind quarters. Mitchel cursed himself for the bad shot. 

The jaguar silently made his way home through the woods that he knew he
would never see again. He remained swift and agile but started to feel the
cold of losing blood. He arrived to find his mate and children sleeping
quietly deep in the brush. He gently woke his mate wanting to see her one
last time. Laying next to her and immersed in the soothing rumble of her
purr, he told her his last story. 

The next evening she got up. Her cubs expecting a lesson in hunting were
told they would need to wait alone this evening. She arrived in town in the
quiet of the early morning as men and women lay sleeping under the security
of nothing more than a sheet or blanket. 

Inside the hunter' cabin a light still burned. The door left half open the
jaguar entered to find the hunter asleep in his chair, the woman lying
uncovered across her bed and the baby quietly whimpering in his crib.  The
smell of the hunter was strong, but stronger was the smell of alcohol and
soiled clothes. 

Resting her paws on the arm of his chair she leaned in close and breathed
her moist hot breath into the hunter's face. Opening his eyes, she bared
her teeth and roared. Screaming he threw his hands forward and pushed
helplessly against her heavily muscled shoulders. She gripped his neck in
her jaw and then crushed his spine. He died instantly the expression of
shock still frozen on his face.

She roared again and the woman stirred. Seeing the jaguar still leaning
over her dead husband she screamed and flung herself toward the crib.
Unable to stand she hung on the bars and sobbed, "Don't take my baby." As
the jaguar came close to her, she was overwhelmed by the stench of alcohol
that seeped from her skin.

The jaguar leaned her paws against the crib and found the boy crying
bruised and sore and lying in his own filth. Disgusted, she leaned her head
over the rails and lifted the boy up by the scruff of his neck. As he felt
the jaguar's sharp teeth gently close about his neck, he stopped crying and
made no attempt to resist. Carrying the boy from the house the jaguar made
her way back to her cubs.

For two years, she raised the boy along with her cubs teaching them to hunt
and survive in the wild and when she had taught them all that she could,
she sent her cubs out on their own. She then led the boy back to town.
Arriving again in the early hours of the morning she left the boy in the
middle of the town square where he sat and amused himself until he was
found the next morning.

The boy was adopted by Nicholas and Svetlana Persopolis, a childless couple
and given the name Adam. It was soon apparent that Adam had special powers.
By an early age he could out run the squirrels that came into their yard
and could leap into trees more than twice his height.  Worried, his parents
begged him to never reveal his secrets. The world had taken much from
Nicholas and he was determined it would not take their boy. 

The mining company for which Nicholas worked, owned the house in which they
lived as well as the stores where they bought their food and the stores
where they bought their clothes, and it made sure that at the end of each
week nothing ever remained on his side of the ledger except his body and
soul for which he was still grateful and which the company would allow him
to keep as long it remained useful.

And when it came time the company took his life as well. Nicholas died
slowly drowning under the soot and ash that filled his lungs and for all of
Adam's powers there was nothing in the world he could do to save him. 

Adam grew tall and handsome and was the star of the high school track team.
He ran just fast enough to bring home the state championship and shined
like hope in the small and smokey town. He also ran just fast enough to get
recruited to the state college. During the summer before he left, his
mother died relieving him of the one last hold the mining town had on him,
and after he left he never returned.

Why does he become a super hero. Why does he reveal his powers to Clay?
Does he save Clay's life? Does Clay hate himself? 

The veracity of the story is questionable. Who would have told it and for
what purpose. Like the origin of many stories. It is possible it was simply
born out of a need for a story.

f the West End was officially announced on April 11, 1953. Mayor Hynes and
the BHA stated that the project would be beneficial to the neighborhood.
The West End's narrow streets were a fire hazard and many of the buildings
were not up to code, with approximately 80% of them substandard or
marginal.[6] Tenants were assured that affordable housing would be found
for them, and many were led to believe that they would be able to move back
into the West End after the project was complete. 

n October 1957, the BRA held a hearing on the new project. At least 200
West End residents attended and the consensus was overwhelmingly opposed to
the plan. The Save the West End committee was formed with the support of
Joseph Lee to organize protests against the new development. Most residents
believed that the project would not be realized, and so did not act until
it was too late.[6]

Residents received their eviction letters on April 25, 1958. The BRA used
the Housing Act of 1949 to raze the West End to the ground. Working-class
families were displaced, and superblocks replaced the original street
layout. The result was a neighborhood consisting of residential high rises,
shopping centers and parking lots.
