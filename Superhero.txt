SUPERHERO

"Could you at least put a towel on?" "I have a towel on." "I am not talking
about your head." "Don't be such a prude. Man's body is beautiful. At least
mine is." 

Adam Persopolis lay on his stomach on a plush pile rug. And it was true,
his body was beautiful. Resting on his forearms he read the Saturday
morning paper. Clay stood behind him trying to decide if he should just
leave. It was a thought that periodically ran through his head and involved
a not so elaborate scenario about where he would go, but he never left. 

Clay turned to the counter to make coffee. Standing by the sink, the
morning sun warmed him as it reached across the horizon and through the
kitchen window.

"Cynthia Champion has agreed to star in Sydney Howard's latest production."
Adam said as he continued reading the paper. "I hope it is better than his
last one." Clay said through the steam rising off his cup of coffee. "With
Cynthia Champion it can't be all bad." Adam replied. Clay stared at the
outline of the kitchen window painted diagonally across Adam's body.

"Are you going to lie there all day?" Clay asked. "I can't read the paper?"
Clay eyed a bottle of vodka that had been left on the cabinet from last
night and then the clock counting the hours and minutes till noon. "We
should get out." "How about we go to the Tavern for lunch?" "Fine." "You
heard that Lawson Properties is planning on buying that block." "Yeah, I
know."

Adam and Clay had known each other since college and had lived together
since they were in their twenties. Their home was a small and nondescript
brick building in an underused section of the city set among other small
and nondescript brick buildings. The original purpose of their building was
unclear but over the past century it had housed a variety of small industry
that had come into and gone out of fashion, the last one being typewriter
sales and repair.

They lived primarily on the second of the two floors. It was mostly open
space with their bedrooms off to one side. The open space included a
kitchen, dining and living area delineated only by the appropriate
furniture within each space. Skylights kept the space bright throughout the
day. It was Clay who had directed the renovation of the space from a warren
of small offices. It was also Clay who directed the finding and
refurbishing of the furniture and cabinetry.

A little after noon, Adam and Clay sat across a marbled Formica table in a
tall backed and dimly lit booth.  Stephanie, a woman who looked to be well
into her seventies approached to take their order. A small paper hat sat
neatly on a wavy pile of well coiffed white hair. She wore a light pink
uniform bordered with starched white collar and cuffs and a pleated white
apron tied about her waist. It was the same uniform she had worn for many
years and she still filled it well. But as she stood at their table she
stooped slightly, as if to suggest a change in trajectory.

She had worked at the tavern since Adam and Clay were in their teens and
probably long before. Recognizing them she gave them a hearty "Hi fellas"
adding that she had not seen them for a couple of weeks. She took their
orders with the same professional competence that she had always shown, but
the rhythm of her performance was slightly stilted giving a sense that she
had begun relying more on patterns of habit than inspiration to get through
the day.

Adam noticed her counterpart, a boy still in college and doing his homework
at the bar between waiting on tables. Behind the bar was Francis, who had
owned the tavern for the past fifteen years and had worked there for ten
years before that. Seeing Adam, he came out from behind the bar where he
still worked serving drinks seven days a week.  As he approached he wiped
his hands on an apron that looked dirty enough to make the act a zero sum
affair. In his late fifties, he combed his thin hair over a bald pate.  He
sat down heavily in the booth next to Clay and when asked how things were
going gave his usual answer sighing "Well, I seem to be breaking even." But
there was nothing in his manner or the tavern to suggest that he aspired to
anything more. 

"I have heard a rumor that Lawson Properties is buying the building." Adam
said. "Yeah, I heard that as well. I got nothing against them. Doesn't
matter too much to me who I pay the rent check to." "But what if they ask
for more rent?" asked Clay. "How can they?" responded Francis. "There is no
way I can afford to pay any more than I do. Like trying to get blood from a
stone." He laughed.  Francis found comfort in his logic and Adam and Clay
did not have the heart to challenge him.

Francis returned to the bar. Adam stared off quietly into the tavern
holding a martini poised above the table in his heavy almost muscular
hands. Hands that looked like they had been forged from years of labor. The
sort of hands that Clay's own father had come by honestly, but here they
were on Adam who spent his days typing stories for a local magazine. Clay
admired them, clean and manicured and tucked gently into starched white
cuffs wrapped in fine tweed sleeves. Clay's own hands were long and thin
like his mother's.

Leaving the tavern they walked to the end of the block and stood on the
corner caught in a moment of mutual and unspoken indecision about what to
do with the rest of the day. Clay with a magazine he had purchased tucked
under his arm noticed a young mother hustling her reluctant son along the
street and wondered about the nature of their urgency. Adam watched a lone
seagull flying overhead, blown in from the shore. Its cry out of place over
the rumble of buses and honking horns. When too much time had passed, they
agreed to head home.

As they made their way out of the square and down Wilson Ave., they passed
the laundromats and liquors stores that served as the junctions of communal
life. Reaching the corner of large a construction site, they stopped
waiting to pass a line of striking workers that had narrowed the sidewalk
ahead. Next to them a worker leaned against the wall, an unlit cigarette
hung from his mouth.  He patted his pockets in search of a light.  "Hey
buddy" he addressed Adam, "got a match?" "Sure." Adam responded as he
fetched a silver lighter from his breast pocket and leaned over to light
the man's cigarette.

"What's up?" Adam nodded toward the men marching. "Last week one of the
guys got burned on the job and now Mayfair Construction is refusing to pay
his hospital bills." he said between puffs of smoke. "The only reason he
got burned was because a worn out gas line caught fire on the welder which
he told them needed to be replaced. Mayflower's been cutting corners since
we started this project. It was only a matter of time before someone got
seriously hurt."

"Whose up there now?" asked Clay. "Scabs" he pointed with his cigarette.
"and I can tell you they have no idea what they are doing." Both Adam and
Clay turned their attention to the scabs who crawled about on the tall
skeleton of iron girders. 

With room to pass on the sidewalk, Adam and Clay wished the man good luck
and started to make their way past the protesters. Just before they reached
the end of the block they heard a cry from above. They looked up to see a
section of scaffolding falling from the fifth floor of the building like an
insect, its spindly legs reached in vain for purchase until it came
crashing into the pavement below.

Looking up they could see a worker dangling by a rope from the fifth floor
of the building. 

Instantly, Adam was gone from Clay's side and there appeared leaping from
one floor to the next on the outside of the building, a man in a costume of
tan and black that fit tightly against his body. Reaching the third floor
he pulled the dangling worker up to safety. A crowd of scabs rushed to
greet him. Down below from where Clay stood, the striking workers pointed
toward the man in costume and said "Look its Superman!"

This was the name he had been given by the public and a direct reference to
the comic book hero with whom he shared some super human abilities. But
Adam was not born on a distant planet nor cast toward Earth moments before
its destruction. He was of the Earth and while there are many stories told
of his origin there is only one true story.

He was born the only son of Sarah and Mitchel Clydesdale in the rural
mining town of Havilah. Mitchel spent his days in the mines and his nights
in the local tavern where he drank till the pain that lived inside of him
could raise no more than a grumble. Sometimes he went home too early, short
of money and raised holy hell with Sarah who could match him drink for
drink and blow for blow. 

On Sundays, Mitchel went out into the woods to hunt for deer, but shot just
about anything that had the misfortune to cross his path. Hunting was one
of the few things he did well, drunk or sober. One Sunday, a jaguar sat
hidden in rocky outcrop. The jaguar knew not to be out during daylight
hours, but his family was hungry and man left little in the land they
shared. As he waited, a deer came into view only 50 yards below. As he
inched forward into the open to prepare his attack, he suddenly saw a
hunter out of the corner of his eye. It was the sort of carelessness that
he typically attributed to man. Mitchel had seen the same deer and now he
saw the jaguar. He turned and shot. Leaping forward the jaguar caught the
bullet in his hind quarters. Mitchel cursed himself for the bad shot. 

The jaguar silently made his way home through the woods that he knew he
would never see again. He remained swift and agile but started to feel the
cold of losing blood. He arrived to find his mate and children sleeping
quietly deep in the brush. He gently woke his mate wanting to see her one
last time. Laying next to her and immersed in the soothing rumble of her
purr, he apologized for dying too soon.

The next evening she got up. Her cubs expecting a lesson in hunting were
told they would need to wait alone this evening. She arrived in town in the
quiet of the early morning as men and women lay sleeping under the security
of nothing more than a sheet or blanket. 

Inside the hunter's cabin a light still burned. The door left half open the
jaguar entered to find the hunter asleep in his chair, the woman lying
uncovered across her bed and the baby quietly whimpering in his crib.  The
smell of the hunter was strong, but stronger was the smell of alcohol and
soiled clothes. 

Resting her paws on the arm of his chair she leaned in close and breathed
her moist hot breath into the hunter's face. Opening his eyes, she bared
her teeth and roared. Screaming he threw his hands forward and pushed
helplessly against her heavily muscled shoulders. She gripped his neck in
her jaw and then crushed his spine. He died instantly the expression of
shock still frozen on his face.

She roared again and the woman stirred. Seeing the jaguar still leaning
over her dead husband she screamed and flung herself toward the crib.
Unable to stand she hung on the bars and sobbed, "Don't take my baby." As
the jaguar came close to her, she was overwhelmed by the stench of alcohol
that leached from the woman's skin.

The jaguar leaned her paws against the crib and found the boy crying
bruised and sore and lying in his own filth. Disgusted, she leaned her head
over the rails and lifted the boy up by the scruff of his neck. As the boy
felt the jaguar's sharp teeth gently close about his neck, he stopped
crying and made no attempt to resist. Carrying the boy from the house the
jaguar made her way back to her cubs.

For two years, she raised the boy along with her cubs teaching them to hunt
and survive in the wild and when she had taught them all that she could,
she sent her cubs out on their own. She then led the boy back to town.
Arriving again in the early hours of the morning she left the boy in the
middle of the town square where he sat and amused himself until he was
found the next morning.

The boy was adopted by a childless couple, Nicholas and Svetlana Persopolis
who named him Adam. It was soon apparent that Adam had special powers.  By
an early age he could outrun the squirrels that came into their yard and
could leap into trees more than twice his height.  Worried, his parents
begged him to never reveal his secrets. The world had taken much from
Nicholas and he was determined it would not take his boy. 

The mining company, for which Nicholas worked, owned the house in which he
lived and the stores in which he bought his food, and at the end of each
month after he paid for his house and his food, it left little on his side
of the ledger except for life itself, for which he was still grateful and
which the company would allow him to keep as long it remained useful.

And when it came time the company took his life as well. Nicholas died
slowly drowning under the soot and ash that filled his lungs and for all of
Adam's powers there was nothing in the world he could do to save him. 

Adam grew tall and handsome and was the fastest boy the town had ever seen.
He broke high school records in both short and long distances as well as in
field events such as long jump and javelin, and for a few years he shined
like hope in the small and smokey town. He ran just fast enough to bring
home the state championship and he ran just fast enough to get a
scholarship to the state college. During the summer before he left, his
mother got sick and died relieving him of the one remaining hold the mining
town had on him, and after he left he never returned.

Clay watched as Adam leaped down from the building and quickly away into an
alley or backyard. It was up to Clay to fetch his clothes and then find a
place where Adam could change before heading home. No matter where Clay
went, Adam would find him.

They met during their freshman year of college. One night after a party
Clay was walking home across a bridge that connected the two campuses,
alone and drunk. He does not remember walking into the street, but he does
remember Adam coming from out of nowhere and grabbing and lifting him out
of the way of the truck and then with super human speed carrying him over
and off the bridge. 

He also remembers walking up in Adam's dorm room and seeing Adam standing
over him looking down. "I saved your life last night." he smiled.  "I'm
sorry." said Clay still blinking the sleep from his eyes. "Why?" Adam
laughed. "It felt pretty good." "Well, let's not make a habit of it." Clay
said turning his head.  Clay, embarrassed tried to get up to leave, but
Adam made him stay and that morning they had breakfast together in the
dinning hall.

"I think I want to save more lives." Adam confessed to Clay that morning.
"Well that is certainly a noble desire." Clay leaned back and chucked, not
sure what to make of his new found friend. Adam leaned in toward Clay and
said earnestly "Yes, but I can." Clay narrowed his eyes and looked at Adam
for a moment "But why?" he said and then "how?" for the first time
acknowledging that maybe the events of the previous night could be
explained by something other than the fog of intoxication. "I don't know. I
just can." Adam shrugged his shoulders as he leaned back in his chair
clasping his hands behind his head.

He told Clay of finding out at an early age that he was faster and stronger
than other children and then finding out that he was faster and stronger
than anyone. He confessed he knew of no explanation.  

"So you want to be a superhero." said Clay "Wouldn't you?" asked Adam. "I
guess, yeah." Clay nodded. "You will need a disguise." Clay mused. "Can you
help me?" 

Clay was the only one of three brothers to attend college. His father had
worked as a plumber for the department of public works making sure that
every day fresh water flowed into the city and every day waste water flowed
out. But he wanted more for Clay. Clay, unlike his brothers, liked school
and brought home report cards that included As and kind words from his
teachers. His father wanted Clay to be an engineer, to design and build the
sort of machinery he had spent his days repairing.

Clay agreed to sew Adam's first costume. He had watched his mother hem and
repair his own clothes and took to sewing easily. The early costume was a
simple affair that covered Adam from head to toe with openings for his
hands, mouth and eyes. Early revisions included insulation for warmth
and protection from impact.

Finding people to save proved difficult. There was, of course, no lack of
people facing various sorts of mortal danger, but much of it was known and
long-term, not the sort of danger that lent itself to a superhero rescue.
For Adam, the danger needed to be acute and sudden, which also raised the
problem of timing, essentially how to locate a victim in mid-peril.

For a while Clay volunteered as a dispatcher for the college crisis hotline
center. After directing an emergency rescue team to a crisis scene, he
would sometimes try to reach Adam through the one payphone on their dorm
floor. Though often the rescue team would have arrived before Adam could
get there and were generally far better equipped to deal with the sorts of
crisis they faced. Frustrated, Adam would stay hidden watching the
paramedics or fire crew adeptly manage the situation.

Then one evening, due to some confusion regarding the actual location of a
victim, Adam found himself on the scene first. A woman lay unconscious on
the floor of her dorm room, her roommate beside her sobbing. Adam quickly
picked up the unconscious woman and raced her to the hospital leaving her
in the hands of the emergency room doctors.

The story was reported and the witnesses credible, but their claims so
outrageous that the short article received the dubious headline "Mystery
Man Rescues Drunk Teenage Girl" and it was viewed about as credible as a
UFO siting.  It did not help Adam's sense of accomplishment that the
article suggested that the young woman would have likely been better served
by a team of qualified paramedics.

Adam leaned back in his chair with his feet up on the desk in the dorm room
they now shared, staring out the window. "There is no way I could have
known that she was just drunk." And when Adam did not respond, Clay added
"It is not like people who call crisis hotlines actually know what is going
on themselves." He paused and then went on, "Your the one who wanted to be
a superhero anyway." "I am a superhero!" insisted Adam still not looking at
Clay. "It is the reason why I am here." "Well it is not my fault." Clay
responded.  Adam just shook his head quietly.

"Let's get out of here." Adam let his chair land back on the front legs and
quickly up grabbing his coat. "I am sure there is a party somewhere just
waiting for us." 

Over the next month, Clay found and then modified an existing radio so that
it could scan and receive the police and fire broadcast channels. They
spent evenings together listing to the radio for reports of people in
distress. Adam's rescues mostly involved carrying people out of burning
buildings, though once from a car before it exploded. He was fast and
strong and could leap through flames without getting burnt. Partially, this
was due to his speed and partially this was due to a fire retardant
material that Clay manufactured for his costume.

Adam began to receive notoriety for his exploits and was quickly dubbed
Superman by the local press. Though not all the press he received was
positive as fire officials complained that he often interfered with their
own rescue attempts.

One afternoon late in their junior year as they both sat in their dorm
skipping an economics class and nursing hangovers, the report of a bank
robbery came over the scanner. Adam was quickly out the door and on his
way.

Adam saved a... and was able to thwart a bank robbery. but found the
experience less than rewarding. He got his name in the paper and was the
first time he was considered a superhero by the press. Not quite sure what
was wrong


He wanted to fight villains, super villains that is what superheros did.
Through college he kept up his skills fight small crimes. Until he finally
felt like he needed to do more.

Who are the really bad people. Basically he continues try to fight crime
until he finds this one real bad realestate guy.




For the next three years they roomed together and drank together and went
to parties together where girls flirted with Adam and confided in Clay.

"Here" Clay handed Adam his shirt and pants. "What's wrong?" Adam asked.
"Nothing." said Clay and then as Adam quietly put his pants on over his
costume tights added. "You didn't have to save him." "I should have let him
fall?" Adam stopped and looked at Clay. "No." Clay said looking down at the
shoes he was holding, "but one of the workers would have pulled him up."
"Well that did not seem to be happening." Adam resumed getting dressed.
They began their walk home in silence. A few minutes later, Adam said,
"Maybe I should have let him fall." "What do you mean?" Clay asked. He
could not tell if Adam was teasing. "I didn't just save him. I saved
Mayfair construction from being forced to address their injustice toward
workers.  It is possible that in the end more workers will be hurt because
of my actions." Clay shook his head because he knew Adam's thoughts were
sincere. "I think I need drink." Adam put his arm around Clay's shoulders
and laughed.

They spent the remainder of the day inside staying just south of sober.
That evening they headed across the river to Eastside. It was a short walk
from where the train left them off in mid-town, but they could not recall
ever going there since they had lived in the city. The area was boarded by
Claremont Ave., a busy street that cut across the city. Crossing the
street, they could see a woman shouting at them from a second story window,
but they could not hear what she said over the noise of traffic. Turning
into the neighborhood they passed an alley where a ball came flying well
over their heads. Adam jumped too high and caught the ball. The kids
playing stick ball in the alley shouted with excitement, still young enough
to welcome miracles into their world.

They passed markets and barbershops and newsstands and theaters all very
much alive among a few buildings that had already been razed or boarded up.
They entered a tavern under a small unlit sign and took seats at the bar.
Adam got the attention of the bartender and ordered two martinis.
"Martinis?" said the man sitting next to Adam to no one but the bar itself.
"I think you boys are on the wrong side of town." his words slowly
stumbling over each other on their way to the end of his sentence.  "Oh,
hold on" he held up one hand to stop himself.  "If you kids just sit and
wait here" he paused to steady his thoughts. "in less than a year then you
and your little friend can order as many martinis as you like." He then
toasted himself and took another sip of whatever liquor the bartender had
used to fill his glass.

The man sitting next to him leaned forward and said, "I apologize for my
friend here. As you can see, he has had a few too many and, these days the
only well-dressed people we get around here, come to...well, to measure our
coffins." He grinned and took a sip of his beer. "I have heard about the
plans for tearing down this section of town." Adam said. "Well what do you
think? Out with the old and in with the new?" the man asked.  "Well, to be
honest, we don't know much about it.  There has not been much news, at
least, that we have heard." "And I'm sure they want to keep it that way."
the man said. "Mitchum's more worried about selling ads than winning any
prizes for journalism." Mitchum was the long-time editor of the city paper.

"Maybe we can help." said Adam leaning forward to look at the man. "Maybe
you can help?" he laughed. "Our knight in fine wool tweed." He said not
bothering to look back at Adam. "I'm a journalist." said Adam. "I could
write a story. I could tell your story."

"Have you ever been to Eastside? I mean have you ever been here before
tonight?" he asked now looking at Adam. "No" acknowledged Adam. "And now
you want to come here to save us?  And what is in it for you?" "I'm not
sure I understand?" said Adam and then after a pause. "I guess the pride of
helping others." "The pride of helping others." the man smiled and shook
his head. "And what about our pride?" he continued to grin. After no one
spoke for a few seconds. The man said, "Listen, I don't mean to bust your
balls."  and then pointed to a booth with his beer "Here lets have a seat.
I'll tell you the story and maybe you can save us."

They moved to a large booth in the corner of the room. The man introduced
himself as Peter Lansky. He was was born in Eastside. His father had lived
here back when there were separate sections for the Poles and the Italians.

He said how under the Federal Housing Act of 1954 the federal government
was essentially providing financial incentives for cities and developers to
raze and redevelop entire neighborhoods. The city could use the right of
eminent domain to appropriate any area they deemed in need of renewal. The
developers would get paid and he was sure there was something in it for the
politicians as well.

He told them how the city had essentially condemned Eastside, claiming that
the narrow streets were a fire hazard and that approximately 80 percent of
the buildings were either substandard or marginal.

Eastside covered over 46 acres of land and housed 2700 families. The people
had been promised that affordable housing would be found for them and many
were led to believe that they would move back into the West End after the
project was complete. Through a friend at City Hall, Peter had seen plans
for the five residential high rises that would be built on superblocks
replacing the original city layout. They would include only 477 apartments
with shopping centers and parking lots aimed at the upper middle class.

"So what are you going to do?" asked Adam. Peter rubbed the scar on his
cheek with his thumb. It was raised and smooth but of inconsistent width,
like a river that swelled and narrowed as it made its way from cheekbone to
jawline. "We will keep fighting." he smiled.

Just then two of Peter's friends waved to him from the entrance to the bar.
They were both tall and broad much like Adam, but unlike Adam carried their
weight like a burden as they plowed their way across the bar making little
effort to navigate around the maze of tables and chairs.

Peter introduced them as brothers, Sam and Jake. "I'm was just telling
these gentlemen about the future of Eastside." "Yeah, some future." Jake
said. "But if he says he got a condo to sell you, don't trust him. He's
getting tossed out of here just like the rest of us."

They both looked at Adam and Clay. "Adam's a writer." Jake filled them in.
"He wants to write a story about Eastside. He writes for magazine that is
popular with the folks across the river." "Yeah" said Jake. "Get all the
kids from State College to come over here and protest. The city's gotta be
a lot more careful with the college kids." He said sarcastically.

"Hanny went to State." said Sam. "Hanny played football." said Jake said as
if this was not the same thing. "Hanny Nowak? I played with him for two
years." said Adam who had switched from track to football for his junior and
senior year. 

"You played with Hanny." Jake said as he looked at Adam trying to reframe
his initial impression. "He was a year a head of us, but we all played
together in high school. What a great kid." Jake then reached over to shake
Adam's hand. "Too bad what happened." Jake added. Hanny had gone on to play
professional football for a couple of years but then got dropped from the
league. A year later he was found dead. The cause of death was
inconclusive, but everyone suspected suicide.

"Don't suppose you played football as well?" Jake laughed as he punched
Clay in the shoulder just hard enough that he spilled his drink. "Jake."
Peter said shaking his head.

So what are you going to do. We will continue to protest. The problem is
that many people don't believe it will happen and some have been told that
they will get their house back. 

Peter's friends join them. Rough and strong. Fighters. They will kick some
ass. They vandalize equipment. March in the street. Small things then much
bigger things.

The police fight back and super man saves them.

Where are you both from? We live across the river. College kids said his
friend. So what do you care what happens on this side of town. When was the
last time you came here. Well we have never been here. What are you three
going to do. You come here to tell us what to do? Adam had played football
and still enjoyed going to the game. He played in a famous game. Knew one
of their friends. A woman joins them and flirts with Adam.

We spike the trucks. They can't start because we have spiked the trucks.
They are trying to hire us to take down our own city, so they have bring in
guys from the outside. Yeah will who is this guy. He is with me. He don't
look like no football player.  


In October 1957, the BRA held a hearing on the new project. At least 200
West End residents attended and the consensus was overwhelmingly opposed to
the plan. The Save the West End committee was formed with the support of
Joseph Lee to organize protests against the new development. Most residents
believed that the project would not be realized, and so did not act until
it was too late.[6]

Residents received their eviction letters on April 25, 1958. The BRA used
the Housing Act of 1949 to raze the West End to the ground. Working-class
families were displaced, and superblocks replaced the original street
layout. The result was a neighborhood consisting of residential high rises,
shopping centers and parking lots.

just strength like Captain America. His targets have committed no federal
or state crimes just crimes against the common man. He does not understand
women forever carrying their vestigial glands front and center. He loves
his sidekick and they fall into "low-life" behavior gambling, dirty bars. 

Why do you where those tight clothes. All superheros where tight clothes,
besides I like the way they feel.  You have a suit. I don't understand why
you don't wear it.

Sit one night at home getting drunk. I need a martini. Aren't you supposed
to take care of me. Isn't that what sidekicks are for...to fetch my drinks?
Go fix me a drink. Go fuck yourself. Believe me I have tried. Why do you
always say that. Its not funny. Why do you always tell me to go fuck
myself. Silence.

Clay and Adam met the first week of college. Returning to his dorm from an
early morning class, Clay turned the corner almost bumping into Adam
wearing nothing more than a towel held about his waist. As Clay stepped
back Adam extended his hand in greeting. "Sorry, didn't mean to scare you."
He laughed. Clay mumbled his name and an apology in return. "Hey, have you
eaten?" "No" he had, but not much and couldn't think to explain. "If you
give me a minute, we can grab some breakfast." Clay said that the dining
hall was closing in about ten minutes. "Well, then we'll just head down to
the diner. I'll meet you in the hall." Clay thanked him but then did not
know exactly why he was thanking him and then remembered that he had a
class in twenty minutes, but now he wasn't going to class.

Everyone wanted to be with Adam. He was the star of the track team.
Sometimes sitting at the pizza parlor just the two of them, Clay wanted
people to see them. To see that Adam had chosen him over everyone else.

;a
eautiful boy he had ever seen. He was amazed that he would speak with him.
Everyone loved him and girls were always asking for him. Clay could not
understand why Adam would sometimes sitting in a pizza parlor and wonder
why Adam would spend the evening just with him. The became fast friends.
They drank like most students in college passing out some evenings
together. Then Adam would want to go to parties where everyone loved him
and Clay felt invisible. After one evening, Clay walked home alone on the
bridge that lead to their house. Adam was still at the party. Clay was
drunk. As he wove down the sidewalk he stopped and cried. He did not know
why he cried.  And then stepped into the street in front of an oncoming
truck. Adam who had just come onto the bridge saw him and ran with all of
his speed, grabbed Clay and leaped out of the way of the car. Falling on
the side of the street. Clay conscious enough to know that Adam actions
were far from normal. Adam confesses to Clay.
