SUPERHERO

"Could you at least put a towel on?" "I have a towel on." "I am not talking
about your head." "Don't be such a prude. Man's body is beautiful. At least
mine is." 

Adam Persopolis lay on his stomach on a plush pile rug. And it was true,
his body was beautiful. Resting on his forearms he read the Saturday
morning paper.  Clay stood behind him trying to decide if he should just
leave. It was a thought that periodically ran through his head and involved
a not so elaborate scenario about where he would go, but he never left. 

"Look at this." Adam said as he continued reading the paper. "Layton
Properties is buying another building in the square. It's the one on Bow
St." "Not the old Clark Building?" asked Clay who had turned away from Adam
to pour himself some tea at the kitchen counter. "Yup. That's the one."
Clay put down his cup down and sighed. "Well there goes Stacy's Tavern and
the Bow St. Book Shop." "Yeah, they've kept the theater vacant for years."

Clay turned and sat at the kitchen table and tried unsuccessfully to not
look at Adam's backside.  "What do you say we head down to Stacy's for
lunch and see what is up with this Layton thing?" asked Adam.  "As long as
you put some clothes on." Clay said through the steam rising off his cup of
tea. "Well if you insist.  But I'll just be depriving the public." Adam
smiled to no one as his face was hidden from Clay's view.

Adam and Clay had known each other since high school and had lived together
since they were in their twenties. Their home was a small and nondescript
brick building in a lonely section of the city set among other small and
nondescript brick buildings. The original purpose of their building was
unclear but over the past century it had housed a variety of small industry
that had come into and gone out of fashion, the last one being typewriter
sales and repair.

They lived primarily on the second of two floors. The space was open and
light with one large area for kitchen, dining and living each delineated by
a couch, chairs or a table. Clay had purchased or collected most of the
furnishings and had directed the renovation from what had once been dark
and crowded office space.

A little after noon, Adam and Clay sat across a marbled Formica table in a
tall backed and dimly lit booth. Stephanie, a woman who looked to be well
into her seventies approached to take their order. A small paper hat sat
neatly on a wavy pile of well coiffed white hair. She wore a light pink
uniform with starched white collar and cuffs and had a clean pleated white
apron tied about her waist. It was a uniform she had worn for years and she
still filled it well. But as she stood at their table she stooped slightly,
as if to suggest a change in trajectory.

She had worked at the tavern since Adam and Clay were in their teens and
probably long before. Recognizing them she gave them a hearty "Hi fellas"
adding that she had not seen them for a couple of weeks. She took their
orders with the same professional competence that she had always shown, but
the rhythm of her performance was slightly stilted giving a sense that she
had begun relying more on patterns of habit than inspiration to get through
the day.

Adam noticed her counterpart, a boy still in college and doing his homework
at the bar between waiting on tables. Behind the bar was Francis, who had
owned the tavern for the past fifteen years and had worked there for ten
years before that. Seeing Adam, he came out from behind the bar where he
still worked serving drinks seven days a week.  As he approached he wiped
his hands on an apron that looked dirty enough to make the act a zero sum
affair. In his late fifties, he combed his thin hair over a bald pate.  He
sat down heavily in the booth next to Clay and when asked how things were
going gave his usual answer sighing "Well, I seem to be breaking even." But
there was nothing in his manner or the tavern to suggest that he aspired to
anything more. 

"I hear that Layton Properties is buying the building." Adam said. "Yeah, I
heard that as well. I got nothing against them. Doesn't matter too much to
me who I pay the rent check to." "But what if they ask for more rent?"
asked Clay. "How can they?" responded Francis. "There is no way I can
afford to pay any more than I do. Like trying to get blood from a stone."
He laughed.  Francis really seemed to believe in his logic and Adam and
Clay did not have the heart to enlighten him.

Francis returned to the bar. Adam stared off quietly into the tavern
holding a martini poised above the table in his heavy almost muscular
hands. Hands that looked like they had been forged from years of labor. The
sort of hands that Clay's own father had come by honestly, but here they
were on Adam who spent his days typing stories for a local magazine. Clay
admired them, clean and manicured and tucked gently into starched white
cuffs wrapped in fine tweed sleeves. Clay's own hands were long and thin
like his mother's.

Leaving the tavern they walked down the street to the news stand. Greeting
Angelo, the owner, Adam asked if he had heard about Layton's plans for the
Clark Building. Angelo said he had and figured his own days were numbered
as well. "It would not be long before Layton owned every building in the
square" he said adding. "It's just like he is doing with Eastside." Adam
and Clay had both heard rumours about the city's plans for Eastside, an
large section of the city area across the river. "I had heard the city was
buying properties there." said Clay. "Yes, but it is Layton that is behind
the whole plan and the city is not buying properties it is are condemning
them." said Angelo "Once they condemn a property all of the rent starts
going to the city. The owner becomes desperate to sell and guess who picks
up the property at a bargain price."

"So if it is condemned how can they still be getting rent?" Clay asked.
"Yeah, good question." Angelo responded. "The whole thing is a scam. The
city claims that all of Eastside is a slum and needs to be torn down and
rebuilt with shiny new towers. But whose making all the money, Old Winnie
Layton.  And I am sure he is not the only one whose making a few bucks. If
there is a pot with money in it, you can be sure that Mayor Benny's got a
hand in that pot. I grew up there till I was ten and my father was born
there. It ain't no slum and never was."

They stood on the street corner just outside the news stand caught in a
moment of mutual and unspoken indecision about what to do with the day.
Clay with the magazine he had purchased tucked under his arm, stared at a
woman approaching who, for a moment, he mistook for an ex-girlfriend. Adam
yawned. The wind had picked up. A seagull flew overhead, blown in from the
shore. Its cry out of place over the rumble of buses and honking horns.
When too much time had passed, they agreed to head home.

Up ahead they could see a line of construction workers marching slowly and
methodically in front of a construction site. Arriving at the site, they
stopped to wait their turn to pass on the now narrowed sidewalk.  Next to
them, one of the workers leaned against the wall, an unlit cigarette hung
from his mouth. He patted his pockets in search of a light. "Hey buddy" he
addressed Adam, "got a match?" "Sure." Adam responded as he fetched a
silver lighter from his breast pocket and leaned over to light the man's
cigarette.

"What's up?" Adam nodded toward the men marching. "Last week one of the
guys got burned and now Mayfair Construction is refusing to pay his
hospital bills." he said between puffs of smoke. "The only reason he got
burned was from a worn out gas line on the welder which he told them needed
to be replaced. They been cutting corners since we started this project and
it was only a matter of time before someone got seriously hurt."

"Whose up there now?" asked Clay. "Scabs" he pointed with his cigarette.
"and I can tell you they have no idea what they are doing." Both Adam and
Clay turned their attention to the scabs who crawled about on the giant
skeleton of iron girders. As they watched, they heard the sound of
scaffolding which had been set on the third floor of the building give way.
They turned to see the broken scaffolding fall free of the building and
crash into the pavement below. The worker who had been standing on the
scaffolding fell against the open edge of third floor and then bounced over
the edge instinctively grabbing a rope that, by shear luck, held him
suspended three stories above the pavement.

Instantly, Adam was gone and there appeared climbing the outside of the
building with the agility of a spider, a man in a costume of grey and black
that fit tightly against his body. Reaching the third floor he pulled the
dangling worker to safety. A crowd of workers rushed to greet him and down
below from where Clay stood, workers pointed and he could hear them say,
"Look its Superman!"

This was the name he had been given by the public and a direct reference to
the comic book hero with whom he shared some super human abilities. But he
was not born on a distant planet nor cast toward Earth moments before its
destruction. Adam was solely of the Earth and while there are many stories
of his origin there is only one true story.

He was born the only son of Sarah and Mitchel Clydesdale in the rural
mining town of Havilah. Mitchel spent his days in the mines and his nights
in the local tavern where he drank till the pain that lived inside of him
could raise no more than a grumble. Sometimes he went home too early, short
of money and raised holy hell with Sarah who could match him drink for
drink and blow for blow. Their baby boy just cried all day and cried all
night. 

On Sundays, Mitchel went out into the woods to hunt for deer, but shot just
about anything that had the misfortune to cross his path. Hunting was one
of the few things he did well, drunk or sober. One Sunday, a jaguar sat
hidden in rocky outcrop. He knew not to be out during daylight hours, but
his family was hungry and man left little in the land they shared. As he
waited a deer came into view only 50 yards below. As he inched forward into
the open prepare his attack, he suddenly saw a hunter out of the corner of
his eye. It was the sort of carelessness that he typically attributed to
man. Mitchel had seen the same deer and now he saw the jaguar. He turned
and shot. Leaping forward the jaguar caught the bullet in his hind
quarters. Mitchel cursed himself for the bad shot. 

The jaguar :w

At least this is not the story that is told for Adam was far
to young to know the story for himself. He was, in fact, born of a cat if
they had known...

He was the only son of a miner and homesteader who drink and fight. He
kills a cougar. The cougar comes back and kills him and takes the baby. But
she is punished for taking in the child by her clan. It is against nature,
but all man is against nature, that is not for us to decide. Man is no
longer animal he is a mistake.


Why does he have power?

Edan. A storm? A ship captain brings him from a foreign land? A storm comes

The people cannot know this story if they are part of the story.

A ship captain carries seeds. There needs to be power in the story not just
mystery. Strength must have a reason. The child needs to defend himself.
The power of animals is transferred to him. The mother is strong. The need
for the wolf to change the world. His purpose is to change the mind of man.
So he is part man and part animal. The wolf is lord of the animals and he
gathers his tribe together to  He must be part man

mistake. gone wrong for far too long. Too global.

One story has him the child of wolves brought to the city by a trapper who
found him near death in the frozen.

One story has him 

Adam was born the only child of Wendy Clydesdale. No version of the story
includes a father or much about her personal life though it is agreed that
she came from the rural town of Havilah. At the time of Adam's birth she
lived by herself in a rooming house. Some have her as a factory seamstress
one of the many factories on that side of town. It is said that Adam was
born who cried and coughed on the smoke that was heavy in that part of the
city before many of the factories were shut down or moved. Wendy worried
about and every night would bathe him in warm water she heated on the
stove and rock his tiny body swaddled in warm baby blanket.

the flower grows near the sink in the window. It is bathed in light.
She lives in the city by herself poor. Her child is sick from birth and
sick form the city. For three nights she has dreams about where she grew up
in rural town. She goes there with her baby and finds nothing. The town is
gone. She finds here house. 

The bus driver says. They ain't no one up there in the hills no more. They
all long gone.  An old man appears at the door. He looks familiar like
everyone she has ever seen before but old like age itself. Where has
everyone gone she asks? Gone he says, but will not elaborate. But you are
here. You must rest. Tea to sleep. The next morning he sacrifices the
flower. They remain for a few days. Eating what he finds and catches.
Winter comes and you must go. Back to the city.

But why are you here. Where would I go he smiles.

When Clay thinks of it, it is the most beautiful flower he has every seen
the flower is as beautiful as Adam himself.

the winter is coming and she must return. when she returns she dies. Adam
is raised by adoptive parents.

The veracity of the story is questionable. Who would have told it and for
what purpose. Like the origin of many stories. It is possible it was simply
born out of a need for a story.

It was now Clay's job to  

The sidewalk city on the way home..  Adam and Clay walked home and spent
the remainder of the day inside remaining just south of sober. On the way
home, they had agreed to go out to Eastside for the evening. They generally
spent their nights in familiar haunts this side of the river. They had
become too familiar. A woman was chasing Adam. Do they have debts. Do they

f the West End was officially announced on April 11, 1953. Mayor Hynes and
the BHA stated that the project would be beneficial to the neighborhood.
The West End's narrow streets were a fire hazard and many of the buildings
were not up to code, with approximately 80% of them substandard or
marginal.[6] Tenants were assured that affordable housing would be found
for them, and many were led to believe that they would be able to move back
into the West End after the project was complete. 

n October 1957, the BRA held a hearing on the new project. At least 200
West End residents attended and the consensus was overwhelmingly opposed to
the plan. The Save the West End committee was formed with the support of
Joseph Lee to organize protests against the new development. Most residents
believed that the project would not be realized, and so did not act until
it was too late.[6]

Residents received their eviction letters on April 25, 1958. The BRA used
the Housing Act of 1949 to raze the West End to the ground. Working-class
families were displaced, and superblocks replaced the original street
layout. The result was a neighborhood consisting of residential high rises,
shopping centers and parking lots.
