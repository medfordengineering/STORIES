HERO

"Could you at least put a towel on?" "I have a towel on." "I am not talking
about your head." "Don't be such a prude. Man's body is beautiful. At least
mine is." 

Adam Persopolis lay on his stomach on a plush pile rug. And it was true,
his body was beautiful. Resting on his forearms he read the morning paper.
Clay stood behind him trying to decide if he should just leave. It was a
thought that periodically ran through his head and involved a not so
elaborate scenario about where he would go, but he never left. 

"Look at this." Adam said as he continued reading the paper. "Argus Layton
is buying another building in the square. It's the building on Bow St."
"Not the old Clark Building?" asked Clay who had turned away from Adam to
pour himself some tea at the kitchen counter. "Yup. That's the one." Clay
put down his cup down and sighed. "Well there goes Stacy's Tavern and the
Bow St. Book Shop." "Yeah, he's kept the theater vacant for years."

Clay turned, sat at the kitchen table and tried unsuccessfully to not look
at Adam.  "What do you say we head down to Stacy's for lunch and see what
is up with this Layton thing?" asked Adam.  "As long as you put some
clothes on." Clay said through the steam of his tea that was still too hot
to drink. "Well if you insist.  But I'll just be depriving the public."
Adam smiled to no one as his face was hidden from Clay's view.

Adam and Clay had known each other since high school and had lived together
since they were in their twenties. Their home was a small and nondescript
brick building in a lonely section of the city set among other small and
nondescript brick buildings. The original purpose of their building was
unclear but over the past century it had housed a variety of small industry
that had come into and gone out of fashion, the last one being typewriter
sales and repair.

They lived primarily on the second of two floors. The space was open and
light with one large area for kitchen, dining and living each delineated by
a couch, chairs or a table. Clay had purchased or collected most of the
furnishings and had directed the renovation from what had been dark and
crowded office space.

A little after noon, Adam and Clay sat across a Formica table in a tall
backed and dimly lit booth. Stephanie, a woman who looked to be well into
her seventies approached to take their order. A small paper hat sat neatly
on a wavy pile of well coiffed white hair. She wore a light pink uniform
with starched white collar and cuffs and had a clean pleated white apron
tied about her waist. It was a uniform she had worn for years and she still
filled it well, but stood at their table slightly stooped, as if to suggest
a change in trajectory.

She had worked at the tavern since Adam and Clay were in their teens and
probably long before. Against her will, her slightly intimidating demeanor
had softened in recent years. She called them and everyone else "hun" and
did her best to recall some event or story that would that would make a
connection between this visit and their previous visit to the diner. 

She had done her job well for years even more than that. She was a
consumente professional. She had instilled it with pride.

She was no running on autopilot.

Francis the owner was neither young nor efficient.

They sat in booth that
probably dated from the last renovation in 1950. It had not been decorated
so much as accumulated. Francis Stacy still worked behind the bar. His
son...and his daughter worked on her laptop for school between serving
customers.

never happens." Other heros come in after the disaster. But our disasters

"What does it say about the pipeline protest?"
asked Clay who had turned away from Adam to pour himself some tea at the
kitchen counter. Adam turned back a few pages, "It looks like the forces
for good are still holding strong. The state halted work on the pipeline
while they review the most recent claims made by native Americans." "That's
not going to hold them up too long."

He fights against common capitalistic aggression. He is not appreciated. He
has a sidekick. He lives like the batman character. He drinks. He is macho
to hide is own insecurity about his sexuality. His super power is mostly
just strength like Captain America. His targets have committed no federal
or state crimes just crimes against the common man. He does not understand
women forever carrying their vestigial glands front and center. He loves
his sidekick and they fall into "low-life" behavior gambling, dirty bars. 

Why do you where those tight clothes. All superheros where tight clothes,
besides I like the way they feel.  You have a suit. I don't understand why
you don't wear it.

Sit one night at home getting drunk. I need a martini. Aren't you supposed
to take care of me. Isn't that what sidekicks are for...to fetch my drinks?
Go fix me a drink. Go fuck yourself. Believe me I have tried. Why do you
always say that. Its not funny. Why do you always tell me to go fuck
myself. Silence.
