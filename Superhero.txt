HERO

"Could you at least put a towel on?" "I have a towel on." "I am not talking
about your head." "Don't be such a prude. Man's body is beautiful. At least
mine is." 

Adam Persopolis lay on his stomach on a plush pile rug. And it was true,
his body was beautiful. Resting on his forearms he read the morning paper.
Clay stood behind him trying to decide if he should just leave. It was a
thought that periodically ran through his head and involved a not so
elaborate scenario about where he would go, but he never left. 

"Look at this." Adam said as he continued reading the paper. "Layton
Properties is buying another building in the square. It's the one on Bow
St." "Not the old Clark Building?" asked Clay who had turned away from Adam
to pour himself some tea at the kitchen counter. "Yup. That's the one."
Clay put down his cup down and sighed. "Well there goes Stacy's Tavern and
the Bow St. Book Shop." "Yeah, they've kept the theater vacant for years."

Clay turned and sat at the kitchen table and tried unsuccessfully to not
look at Adam's backside.  "What do you say we head down to Stacy's for
lunch and see what is up with this Layton thing?" asked Adam.  "As long as
you put some clothes on." Clay said through the steam rising off his cup of
tea. "Well if you insist.  But I'll just be depriving the public." Adam
smiled to no one as his face was hidden from Clay's view.

Adam and Clay had known each other since high school and had lived together
since they were in their twenties. Their home was a small and nondescript
brick building in a lonely section of the city set among other small and
nondescript brick buildings. The original purpose of their building was
unclear but over the past century it had housed a variety of small industry
that had come into and gone out of fashion, the last one being typewriter
sales and repair.

They lived primarily on the second of two floors. The space was open and
light with one large area for kitchen, dining and living each delineated by
a couch, chairs or a table. Clay had purchased or collected most of the
furnishings and had directed the renovation from what had once been dark
and crowded office space.

A little after noon, Adam and Clay sat across a marbled Formica table in a
tall backed and dimly lit booth. Stephanie, a woman who looked to be well
into her seventies approached to take their order. A small paper hat sat
neatly on a wavy pile of well coiffed white hair. She wore a light pink
uniform with starched white collar and cuffs and had a clean pleated white
apron tied about her waist. It was a uniform she had worn for years and she
still filled it well. But as she stood at their table she stooped slightly,
as if to suggest a change in trajectory.

She had worked at the tavern since Adam and Clay were in their teens and
probably long before. Recognizing them she gave them a hearty "Hi fellas"
adding that she had not seen them for a couple of weeks. She took their
orders with the same professional competence that she had always shown, but
the rhythm of her performance was slightly stilted giving a sense that she
had begun relying more on patterns of habit than inspiration to get through
the day.

Adam noticed her counterpart, a boy still in college and doing his homework
at the bar between waiting on tables. Behind the bar was Francis, who had
owned the tavern for the past fifteen years and had worked there for ten
years before that. Seeing Adam, he came out from behind the bar where he
still worked serving drinks seven days a week.  As he approached he wiped
his hands on an apron that looked dirty enough to make the act a zero sum
affair. In his late fifties, he combed his thin hair over a bald pate.  He
sat down heavily in the booth next to Clay and when asked how things were
going gave his usual answer sighing "Well, I seem to be breaking even." But
there was nothing in his manner or the tavern to suggest that he aspired to
anything more. 

"I hear that Layton Properties is buying the building." Adam said. "Yeah, I
heard that as well. I got nothing against them. Doesn't matter too much to
me who I pay the rent check to." "But what if they ask for more rent?"
asked Clay. "How can they?" responded Francis. "There is no way I can
afford to pay any more than I do. Like trying to get blood from a stone."
He laughed.  Francis really seemed to believe in his logic and Adam and
Clay did not have the heart to enlighten him.

Francis returned to the bar. Adam stared off quietly into the tavern
holding a martini poised above the table in his heavy almost muscular
hands. Hands that looked like they had been forged from years of labor. The
sort of hands that Clay's own father had come by honestly, but here they
were on Adam who spent his days typing stories for a local magazine. Clay
admired them, clean and manicured and tucked gently into starched white
cuffs wrapped in fine tweed sleeves. Clay's own hands were long and thin
like his mother's.

Leaving the tavern they walked down the street to the news stand. Greeting
Angelo, the owner, Adam asked if he had heard about Layton's plans for the
Clark Building. Angelo said he had and figured his own days were numbered
as well. It would not be long before Layton owned every building in the
square he figured. "It's just like he is doing with Eastside." He said.
Adam and Clay had both heard rumours about the city's plans for Eastside,
an area across the river. "I had heard the city was buying properties
there." said Clay. "Yes, but it is all being orchestrated by Layton and the
city is not buying properties they are condemning them." said Angelo "Once
they condemn a property all of the rent starts going to the city. The owner
becomes desperate to sell and guess who picks them up at a bargain price."

"So if it is condemned why are they getting rent?" Yeah, good question. "It
is all a scam. The city claims the whole area is a slum and needs to be
torn down and rebuilt with nice shiny new towers. But whose making all the
money. Old Winnie Layton.  And he is not the only one whose making a few
bucks I am sure. I there is a buck to be made, you can bet Mayor Benny is
in on it." I grew up there till I was ten and my father was born there. It
ain't no slum and never was.

f the West End was officially announced on April 11, 1953. Mayor Hynes and
the BHA stated that the project would be beneficial to the neighborhood.
The West End's narrow streets were a fire hazard and many of the buildings
were not up to code, with approximately 80% of them substandard or
marginal.[6] Tenants were assured that affordable housing would be found
for them, and many were led to believe that they would be able to move back
into the West End after the project was complete. 

n October 1957, the BRA held a hearing on the new project. At least 200
West End residents attended and the consensus was overwhelmingly opposed to
the plan. The Save the West End committee was formed with the support of
Joseph Lee to organize protests against the new development. Most residents
believed that the project would not be realized, and so did not act until
it was too late.[6]

Residents received their eviction letters on April 25, 1958. The BRA used
the Housing Act of 1949 to raze the West End to the ground. Working-class
families were displaced, and superblocks replaced the original street
layout. The result was a neighborhood consisting of residential high rises,
shopping centers and parking lots.

asked Clay who had turned away from Adam to pour himself some tea at the
kitchen counter. Adam turned back a few pages, "It looks like the forces

Go fix me a drink. Go fuck yourself. Believe me I have tried. Why do you
always say that. Its not funny. Why do you always tell me to go fuck
