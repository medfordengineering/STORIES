SUPERHERO

"Could you at least put a towel on?" "I have a towel on." "I am not talking
about your head." "Don't be such a prude. Man's body is beautiful. At least
mine is." 

Adam Persopolis lay on his stomach on a plush pile rug. And it was true,
his body was beautiful. Resting on his forearms he read the Saturday
morning paper.  Clay stood behind him trying to decide if he should just
leave. It was a thought that periodically ran through his head and involved
a not so elaborate scenario about where he would go, but he never left. 

"Look at this." Adam said as he continued reading the paper. "Layton
Properties is buying another building in the square. It's the one on Bow
St." "Not the old Clark Building?" asked Clay who had turned away from Adam
to pour himself some coffee at the kitchen counter. "Yup. That's the one."
Clay put down his cup down and sighed. "Well there goes Stacy's Tavern and
the Bow St. Book Shop." "Yeah, they've kept the theater vacant for years."

Clay turned and sat at the kitchen table and tried unsuccessfully to avoid
looking at Adam's backside.  "What do you say we head down to Stacy's for
lunch and see what is up with this Layton thing?" asked Adam.  "As long as
you put some clothes on." Clay said through the steam rising off his cup of
coffee. "Well if you insist.  But I'll just be depriving the public." Adam
smiled to no one as his face was hidden from Clay's view.

Adam and Clay had known each other since high school and had lived together
since they were in their twenties. Their home was a small and nondescript
brick building in a lonely section of the city set among other small and
nondescript brick buildings. The original purpose of their building was
unclear but over the past century it had housed a variety of small industry
that had come into and gone out of fashion, the last one being typewriter
sales and repair.

They lived primarily on the second of two floors. The space was open and
light with one large area for kitchen, dining and living each delineated by
a couch, chairs or a table. Clay had purchased or collected most of the
furnishings and had directed the renovation from what had once been dark
and crowded office space.

A little after noon, Adam and Clay sat across a marbled Formica table in a
tall backed and dimly lit booth. Stephanie, a woman who looked to be well
into her seventies approached to take their order. A small paper hat sat
neatly on a wavy pile of well coiffed white hair. She wore a light pink
uniform with starched white collar and cuffs and had a clean pleated white
apron tied about her waist. It was a uniform she had worn for years and she
still filled it well. But as she stood at their table she stooped slightly,
as if to suggest a change in trajectory.

She had worked at the tavern since Adam and Clay were in their teens and
probably long before. Recognizing them she gave them a hearty "Hi fellas"
adding that she had not seen them for a couple of weeks. She took their
orders with the same professional competence that she had always shown, but
the rhythm of her performance was slightly stilted giving a sense that she
had begun relying more on patterns of habit than inspiration to get through
the day.

Adam noticed her counterpart, a boy still in college and doing his homework
at the bar between waiting on tables. Behind the bar was Francis, who had
owned the tavern for the past fifteen years and had worked there for ten
years before that. Seeing Adam, he came out from behind the bar where he
still worked serving drinks seven days a week.  As he approached he wiped
his hands on an apron that looked dirty enough to make the act a zero sum
affair. In his late fifties, he combed his thin hair over a bald pate.  He
sat down heavily in the booth next to Clay and when asked how things were
going gave his usual answer sighing "Well, I seem to be breaking even." But
there was nothing in his manner or the tavern to suggest that he aspired to
anything more. 

"I hear that Layton Properties is buying the building." Adam said. "Yeah, I
heard that as well. I got nothing against them. Doesn't matter too much to
me who I pay the rent check to." "But what if they ask for more rent?"
asked Clay. "How can they?" responded Francis. "There is no way I can
afford to pay any more than I do. Like trying to get blood from a stone."
He laughed.  Francis really seemed to believe in his logic and Adam and
Clay did not have the heart to enlighten him.

Francis returned to the bar. Adam stared off quietly into the tavern
holding a martini poised above the table in his heavy almost muscular
hands. Hands that looked like they had been forged from years of labor. The
sort of hands that Clay's own father had come by honestly, but here they
were on Adam who spent his days typing stories for a local magazine. Clay
admired them, clean and manicured and tucked gently into starched white
cuffs wrapped in fine tweed sleeves. Clay's own hands were long and thin
like his mother's.

Leaving the tavern they walked down the street to the news stand. Greeting
Angelo, the owner, Adam asked if he had heard about Layton's plans for the
Clark Building. Angelo said he had and figured his own days were numbered
as well. "It would not be long before Layton owned every building in the
square" he said adding, "It's just like he is doing with Eastside." Adam
and Clay had both heard rumours about the city's plans for Eastside, an
large section of the city area across the river. "I had heard the city was
buying properties there." said Clay. "Yes, but it is Layton that is behind
the whole plan and the city is not buying properties it is condemning
them." said Angelo "Once they condemn a property all of the rent starts
going to the city. The owner becomes desperate to sell and guess who picks
up the property at a bargain price."

"So if it is condemned how can they still be getting rent?" Clay asked.
"Yeah, good question." Angelo responded. "The whole thing is a scam. The
city claims that all of Eastside is a slum and needs to be torn down and
rebuilt with shiny new towers. But whose making all the money, Old Winnie
Layton.  And I am sure he is not the only one whose making a few bucks. If
there is a pot with money in it, you can be sure that Mayor Benny's got a
hand in that pot. I grew up there till I was ten and my father was born
there. It ain't no slum and never was."

Outside the stand Adam and Clay, stood on the street corner caught in a
moment of mutual and unspoken indecision about what to do with the day.
Clay with the magazine he had purchased tucked under his arm, went through
mental list of things he had not done and should have done. Adam just
looked toward the horizon and yawned. The wind had picked up. A seagull
flew overhead, blown in from the shore. Its cry out of place over the
rumble of buses and honking horns.  When too much time had passed, they
agreed to head home.

On the next block they could see a line of construction workers slowly
marching in front of a construction site. Reaching the corner they stopped
to wait their turn to pass the marching workers on the narrowed sidewalk.
Next to them, a worker leaned against the wall, an unlit cigarette hung
from his mouth. He patted his pockets in search of a light.  "Hey buddy" he
addressed Adam, "got a match?" "Sure." Adam responded as he fetched a
silver lighter from his breast pocket and leaned over to light the man's
cigarette.

"What's up?" Adam nodded toward the men marching. "Last week one of the
guys got burned and now Mayfair Construction is refusing to pay his
hospital bills." he said between puffs of smoke. "The only reason he got
burned was from a worn out gas line on the welder which he told them needed
to be replaced. They been cutting corners since we started this project and
it was only a matter of time before someone got seriously hurt."

"Whose up there now?" asked Clay. "Scabs" he pointed with his cigarette.
"and I can tell you they have no idea what they are doing." Both Adam and
Clay turned their attention to the scabs who crawled about on the giant
skeleton of iron girders. As they watched, they heard the sound of
scaffolding which had been set on the third floor of the building give way.
They turned to see the broken scaffolding fall free of the building and
crash into the pavement below. The worker who had been standing on the
scaffolding fell against the open edge of third floor and then bounced over
the edge instinctively grabbing a rope that, by shear luck, held him
suspended three stories above the pavement.

Instantly, Adam was gone and there appeared leaping from one floor to the
next on the outside of the building, a man in a costume of tan and black
that fit tightly against his body. Reaching the third floor he pulled the
dangling worker up to safety. A crowd of scabs rushed to greet him. Down
below from where Clay stood, the striking workers pointed toward the man in
costume and said "Look its Superman!"

This was the name he had been given by the public and a direct reference to
the comic book hero with whom he shared some super human abilities. But he
was not born on a distant planet nor cast toward Earth moments before its
destruction. Adam was of the Earth and while there are many stories told of
his origin there is only one true story.

He was born the only son of Sarah and Mitchel Clydesdale in the rural
mining town of Havilah. Mitchel spent his days in the mines and his nights
in the local tavern where he drank till the pain that lived inside of him
could raise no more than a grumble. Sometimes he went home too early, short
of money and raised holy hell with Sarah who could match him drink for
drink and blow for blow. 

On Sundays, Mitchel went out into the woods to hunt for deer, but shot just
about anything that had the misfortune to cross his path. Hunting was one
of the few things he did well, drunk or sober. One Sunday, a jaguar sat
hidden in rocky outcrop. The jaguar knew not to be out during daylight
hours, but his family was hungry and man left little in the land they
shared. As he waited, a deer came into view only 50 yards below. As he
inched forward into the open to prepare his attack, he suddenly saw a
hunter out of the corner of his eye. It was the sort of carelessness that
he typically attributed to man. Mitchel had seen the same deer and now he
saw the jaguar. He turned and shot. Leaping forward the jaguar caught the
bullet in his hind quarters. Mitchel cursed himself for the bad shot. 

The jaguar silently made his way home through the woods that he knew he
would never see again. He remained swift and agile but started to feel the
cold of losing blood. He arrived to find his mate and children sleeping
quietly deep in the brush. He gently woke his mate wanting to see her one
last time. Laying next to her and immersed in the soothing rumble of her
purr, he apologized for dying too soon.

The next evening she got up. Her cubs expecting a lesson in hunting were
told they would need to wait alone this evening. She arrived in town in the
quiet of the early morning as men and women lay sleeping under the security
of nothing more than a sheet or blanket. 

Inside the hunter' cabin a light still burned. The door left half open the
jaguar entered to find the hunter asleep in his chair, the woman lying
uncovered across her bed and the baby quietly whimpering in his crib.  The
smell of the hunter was strong, but stronger was the smell of alcohol and
soiled clothes. 

Resting her paws on the arm of his chair she leaned in close and breathed
her moist hot breath into the hunter's face. Opening his eyes, she bared
her teeth and roared. Screaming he threw his hands forward and pushed
helplessly against her heavily muscled shoulders. She gripped his neck in
her jaw and then crushed his spine. He died instantly the expression of
shock still frozen on his face.

She roared again and the woman stirred. Seeing the jaguar still leaning
over her dead husband she screamed and flung herself toward the crib.
Unable to stand she hung on the bars and sobbed, "Don't take my baby." As
the jaguar came close to her, she was overwhelmed by the stench of alcohol
that leached from the woman's skin.

The jaguar leaned her paws against the crib and found the boy crying
bruised and sore and lying in his own filth. Disgusted, she leaned her head
over the rails and lifted the boy up by the scruff of his neck. As the boy
felt the jaguar's sharp teeth gently close about his neck, he stopped
crying and made no attempt to resist. Carrying the boy from the house the
jaguar made her way back to her cubs.

For two years, she raised the boy along with her cubs teaching them to hunt
and survive in the wild and when she had taught them all that she could,
she sent her cubs out on their own. She then led the boy back to town.
Arriving again in the early hours of the morning she left the boy in the
middle of the town square where he sat and amused himself until he was
found the next morning.

The boy was adopted by a childless couple, Nicholas and Svetlana Persopolis
who named him Adam. It was soon apparent that Adam had special powers.  By
an early age he could out run the squirrels that came into their yard and
could leap into trees more than twice his height.  Worried, his parents
begged him to never reveal his secrets. The world had taken much from
Nicholas and he was determined it would not take his boy. 

The mining company, for which Nicholas worked, owned the house in which he
lived, and the stores in which he bought his food and his clothing, and at
the end of each month after he paid for his house and his food and his
clothing, it left little on his side of the ledger except for life itself,
for which he was still grateful and which the company would allow him to
keep as long it remained useful.

And when it came time the company took his life as well. Nicholas died
slowly drowning under the soot and ash that filled his lungs and for all of
Adam's powers there was nothing in the world he could do to save him. 

Adam grew tall and handsome and was the fastest boy the town had ever seen.
He broke high school records in both short and long distances as well as in
field events such as long jump and javelin, and for a few years he shined
like hope in the small and smokey town. He ran just fast enough to bring
home the state championship and he ran just fast enough to get a
scholarship to the state college. During the summer before he left, his
mother got sick and died relieving him of the one remaining hold the mining
town had on him, and after he left he never returned.

Clay watched as Adam leaped down from the building and quickly away into an
alley or backyard. It was up to Clay to fetch his clothes and then find a
place where Adam could change before heading home. No matter where Clay
went, Adam would find him.

They met during their freshman year of college. One night after a party
Clay was walking home across a bridge that connected the two campuses,
alone and drunk. He does not remember walking into the street, but he does
remember Adam coming from out of nowhere and grabbing and lifting him out
of the way of the truck and then with super human speed carrying him over
and off the bridge. 

He also remembers walking up in Adam's dorm room and seeing Adam standing
over him looking down. "I saved your life last night." he smiled.  "I'm
sorry." said Clay blinking the sleep from his eyes. "Why?" Adam laughed.
"It felt pretty good." "Well, let's not make a habit of it." Clay said
rubbing his head.  Clay embarrassed tried to get up to leave, but Adam made
him to stay and that morning they had breakfast together in the dinning
hall.

For the next three years they roomed together and drank together and went
to parties together where girls flirted with Adam and confided in Clay.

"Here" Clay handed Adam his shirt and pants. "What's wrong?" Adam asked.
"Nothing." said Clay and then as Adam quietly put his pants on over his
costume tights added. "You didn't have to save him." "I should have let him
fall?" Adam stopped and looked at Clay. "No." Clay said looking down at the
shoes he was holding, "but one of the workers would have pulled him up."
"Well that did not seem to be happening." Adam resumed getting dressed.
They began their walk home in silence. A few minutes later, Adam said,
"Maybe I should have let him fall." "What do you mean?" Clay asked. He
could not tell if Adam was teasing. "I didn't just save him. I saved
Mayfair construction from being forced to address their injustice toward
workers.  It is possible that in the end more workers will be hurt because
of my actions." Clay shook his head because he knew Adam's thoughts were
sincere. "I think I need drink." Adam put his arm around Clay's shoulders
and laughed.

They spent the remainder of the day inside staying just south of sober.
That evening they headed across the river to Eastside. It was a short walk
from where the train left them off in mid-town, but they could not recall
ever going there since they had lived in the city. The area was boarded
Claremont Ave., a busy street that cut across the city. Crossing the
street, a woman shouted at them from a second story window, but they could
not hear what she said over the noise of traffic. Turning into the
neighborhood they passed an alley where a ball came flying well over their
heads. Adam jumped too high and caught the ball. The kids playing stick
ball in the alley shouted with excitement, still young enough to welcome
miracles into their world.

They passed markets and barbershops and newsstands and theaters all very
much alive among a few buildings that had already been razed. They entered
a tavern under a small unlit sign and took seats at the bar. Adam got the
attention of the bartender and ordered two martinis. "Martinis?" said the
man sitting next to Adam to no one but the bar itself. "I think you boys
are on the wrong side of town." his words slowly stumbling over each other
on their way to the end of his sentence.  "Oh, hold on" he held up one hand
to stop himself.  "If you kids just sit and wait here" he paused to steady
his thoughts. "in less than a year then you and your little friend can
order as many martinis as you like." He then toasted himself and took
another sip of whatever liquor the bartender had used to fill his glass.

The man sitting next to him leaned forward and said, "I apologize for my
friend here. As you can see, he has had a few too many and...well, these
days the only well-dressed people we get around here come with measuring
tapes to...well, measure our coffins." He grinned and took a sip of his
beer. "I have heard about the plans for tearing down this section of town."
said Adam. "Well what do you think?" "Well, to be honest, we don't know
much more than that. There has not been much news about it, at least, that
we have heard." "And I'm sure they want to keep it that way." Now leaning
back behind his friend he cocked his head motioned them to a booth.

They moved to a large booth in the corner of the room. The man introduced
himself as Peter Lansky. He was was born in Eastside. His father had lived
here back when there were separate sections for the Poles and the Italians.

He said how under the Federal Housing Act of 1954 the federal government
was essentially providing financial incentives for cities and developers to
raze and redevelop entire neighborhoods. The city could use the right of
eminent domain to appropriate any area they deemed in need of renewal. The
developers would get paid and he was sure there was something in it for the
politicians as well.

He told them how the city had essentially condemned Eastside, claiming that
the narrow streets were a fire hazard and that approximately 80 percent of
the buildings were either substandard or marginal.

Eastside covered over 46 acres of land and housed 2700 families. The people
had been promised that affordable housing would be found for them and many
were led to believe that they would move back into the West End after the
project was complete. Through a friend at City Hall, Peter had seen plans
for the five residential high rises that would be built on superblocks
replacing the original city layout. They would include only 477 apartments
with shopping centers and parking lots aimed at the upper middle class.

"So what are you going to do?" asked Adam. "Peter rubbed the scar on his
cheek with his thumb. It was raised and smooth but of inconsistent width,
like a river that swelled and narrowed as it made its way from cheekbone to
jawline. "We will keep fighting." he smiled.

Just then two of Peter's friends waved to him from across the bar. Joining
them in the booth, Peter introduced them as brothers, Sam and Jake. He told
them that they were talking about the future of Eastside. "Yeah, some
future." Jake said. "You boys looking for a new condo? Just wait a year,
till the city clears us all out. Then you will be all set." Jake added
smiling at Peter. "They've already heard that one." said Peter.

"Well then what are we here for?" asked Sam. "Adam's a writer. He can tell
the story and we need to get the story out, because Ole AJ Mitchum sure as
hell ain't doing it." Alec Mitchum was the editor of the city paper and
known to be in the pocket of whoever paid him. 

"A writer, huh" said Jake.  "He looks big enough to play football. Don't
supposed you played at State?" "I played two years." said Adam who had
switched from track to football for his junior and senior year. "Hey, did
you know Hanny, Hanny Nowak?" asked Sam "Sure. I caught a lot of his
passes" said Adam. "He was a year a head of us, but we all played together
in high school. He was a great kid."  "Hey, I'm starting to like this guy."
Sam said to Peter. "But I'm not so sure about the little one over here." he
pointed at Clay and they all laughed.

"Just don't let him like you too much or you might find your wallet
missing." "I still don't let him in my house alone." "Yeah, but Sandra
does." referring to Jake's girlfriend. At which point Sam shoved Jake so
hard that he knocked into Clay, causing Clay to spill his drink on himself.
"Aw, look what you did. You got the little guy wet."

Why you talking to them. He's a writer and we need to get the word out. We
need to get the construction crews out and all them damned folks from the
city. A writer huh, looks big enough to be a football player  whats wrong
don't want to dirty your hands.

We went to high school together. we playe football together. Don't suppose
you pretty boys know much about that. Adam said he had played at State. 

Jake immediately recognized Adam as a former wide receiver for State. Adam
had gone from track to football for his final two years at college and had
become a minor star on the team. Sam, Jake and Peter had all played
football in high school, but had not moved on to college.

So what are you going to do. We will continue to protest. The problem is
that many people don't believe it will happen and some have been told that
they will get their house back. 

Peter's friends join them. Rough and strong. Fighters. They will kick some
ass. They vandalize equipment. March in the street. Small things then much
bigger things.

The police fight back and super man saves them.

Where are you both from? We live across the river. College kids said his
friend. So what do you care what happens on this side of town. When was the
last time you came here. Well we have never been here. What are you three
going to do. You come here to tell us what to do? Adam had played football
and still enjoyed going to the game. He played in a famous game. Knew one
of their friends. A woman joins them and flirts with Adam.

We spike the trucks. They can't start because we have spiked the trucks.
They are trying to hire us to take down our own city, so they have bring in
guys from the outside. Yeah will who is this guy. He is with me. He don't
look like no football player.  


In October 1957, the BRA held a hearing on the new project. At least 200
West End residents attended and the consensus was overwhelmingly opposed to
the plan. The Save the West End committee was formed with the support of
Joseph Lee to organize protests against the new development. Most residents
believed that the project would not be realized, and so did not act until
it was too late.[6]

Residents received their eviction letters on April 25, 1958. The BRA used
the Housing Act of 1949 to raze the West End to the ground. Working-class
families were displaced, and superblocks replaced the original street
layout. The result was a neighborhood consisting of residential high rises,
shopping centers and parking lots.

Clay and Adam met the first week of college. Returning to his dorm from an
early morning class, Clay turned the corner almost bumping into Adam
wearing nothing more than a towel held about his waist. As Clay stepped
back Adam extended his hand in greeting. "Sorry, didn't mean to scare you."
He laughed. Clay mumbled his name and an apology in return. "Hey, have you
eaten?" "No" he had, but not much and couldn't think to explain. "If you
give me a minute, we can grab some breakfast." Clay said that the dining
hall was closing in about ten minutes. "Well, then we'll just head down to
the diner. I'll meet you in the hall." Clay thanked him but then did not
know exactly why he was thanking him and then remembered that he had a
class in twenty minutes, but now he wasn't going to class.

Everyone wanted to be with Adam. He was the star of the track team.
Sometimes sitting at the pizza parlor just the two of them, Clay wanted
people to see them. To see that Adam had chosen him over everyone else.

;a
eautiful boy he had ever seen. He was amazed that he would speak with him.
Everyone loved him and girls were always asking for him. Clay could not
understand why Adam would sometimes sitting in a pizza parlor and wonder
why Adam would spend the evening just with him. The became fast friends.
They drank like most students in college passing out some evenings
together. Then Adam would want to go to parties where everyone loved him
and Clay felt invisible. After one evening, Clay walked home alone on the
bridge that lead to their house. Adam was still at the party. Clay was
drunk. As he wove down the sidewalk he stopped and cried. He did not know
why he cried.  And then stepped into the street in front of an oncoming
truck. Adam who had just come onto the bridge saw him and ran with all of
his speed, grabbed Clay and leaped out of the way of the car. Falling on
the side of the street. Clay conscious enough to know that Adam actions
were far from normal. Adam confesses to Clay.
