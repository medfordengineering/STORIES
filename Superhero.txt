He fights against common capitalistic aggression. He is not appreciated. He
has a sidekick. He lives like the batman character. He drinks. He is macho
to hide is own insecurity about his sexuality. His super power is mostly
just strength like Captain America. His targets have committed no federal
or state crimes just crimes against the common man. He does not understand
women forever carrying their vestigial glands front and center. He loves
his sidekick and they fall into "low-life" behavior gambling, dirty bars. 

Why do you where those tight clothes. All superheros where tight clothes,
besides I like the way they feel. 

Sit one night at home getting drunk. I need a martini. Aren't you supposed
to take care of me. Go fix me a drink. Go fuck yourself. Believe me I have
tried. Why do you always say that. Its not funny. Why do you always tell me
to go fuck myself. Silence.
