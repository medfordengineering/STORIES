HERO

"Could you at least put a towel on?" "I have a towel on." "I am not talking
about your head." "Don't be such a prude. Man's body is beautiful. At least
mine is." 

Adam Persopolis lay on his stomach on a plush pile rug. And it was true,
his body was beautiful. Resting on his forearms he read the morning paper.
Clay stood behind him trying to decide if he should just leave. It was a
thought that periodically ran through his head and involved a not so
elaborate scenario about where he would go, but he never left. 

"Look at this." Adam said as he continued reading the paper. "Argus Layton
is buying even more buildings in the square. Well there goes Stacy's Tavern
and the Bow St. Book Shop. He has kept the theater vacant for three years."
Adam breathed a long sigh. "What does it say about the pipeline protest?"
asked Clay who had turned away from Adam to pour himself some tea at the
kitchen counter. Adam turned back a few pages, "It looks like the forces
for good are still holding strong. The state halted work on the pipeline
while they review the claims made by native Americans." "That's not going
to hold them up too long." said Clay as he sat at the kitchen table and
tried unsuccessfully to not look at Adam. "What do you say we head down to
Stacy's for lunch and see what is up with this Layton thing?" asked Adam.
"As long as you put some clothes on." Clay said through the steam of his
tea. "Well if you insist.  But I'll just be depriving the public." Adam
smiled to no one as his face was hidden from Clay's view.

Adam and Clay had known each other since high school and had lived together
since they were in their twenties. Their home was a small and nondescript
brick building in a lonely section of the city set among other small and
nondescript brick buildings. The original purpose of their building was
unclear but it had housed a variety of small industry that had come into
and gone out of fashion the last one being typewriter sales and repair.

They lived primarily on the second of two floors. The large space was
filled with light. Clay had purchased most of the furnishings.

A little after noon, Adam and Clay sat across a Formica table in tall
backed and dimly lit booth. Stephanie, a woman in her mid sixties took
their order.  She had worked there for thirty years.  They sat in booth
that probably dated from the last renovation in 1950. It had not been
decorated so much as accumulated. Francis Stacy still worked behind the
bar. His son...and his daughter worked on her laptop for school between
serving customers. 


years. Why
do the politicians let him do this to our city." "There is no law against
being greedy." "I think this has gone too far. I think we need to pay him a
visit." 

The problem is they (city) don't know what we save them from because it
never happens." Other heros come in after the disaster. But our disasters
are not dramatic events but a slow undoing of

He fights against common capitalistic aggression. He is not appreciated. He
has a sidekick. He lives like the batman character. He drinks. He is macho
to hide is own insecurity about his sexuality. His super power is mostly
just strength like Captain America. His targets have committed no federal
or state crimes just crimes against the common man. He does not understand
women forever carrying their vestigial glands front and center. He loves
his sidekick and they fall into "low-life" behavior gambling, dirty bars. 

Why do you where those tight clothes. All superheros where tight clothes,
besides I like the way they feel.  You have a suit. I don't understand why
you don't wear it.

Sit one night at home getting drunk. I need a martini. Aren't you supposed
to take care of me. Isn't that what sidekicks are for...to fetch my drinks?
Go fix me a drink. Go fuck yourself. Believe me I have tried. Why do you
always say that. Its not funny. Why do you always tell me to go fuck
myself. Silence.
