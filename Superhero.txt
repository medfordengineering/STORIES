HERO

"Could you at least put a towel on?" "I have a towel on." "I am not talking
about your head." "Don't be such a prude. Man's body is beautiful. At least
mine is." 

Adam Persopolis lay on his stomach on a plush pile rug. And it was true,
his body was beautiful. Resting on his forearms he read the morning paper.
Clay stood behind him trying to decide if he should just leave. It was a
thought that periodically ran through his head and involved a not so
elaborate scenario about where he would go, but he never left. 

"Look at this." Adam said as he continued reading the paper. "Argus Layton
is buying another building in the square. It's the building on Bow St."
"Not the old Clark Building?" asked Clay who had turned away from Adam to
pour himself some tea at the kitchen counter. "Yup. That's the one." Clay
put down his cup down and sighed. "Well there goes Stacy's Tavern and the
Bow St. Book Shop." "Yeah, he's kept the theater vacant for years."

Clay turned, sat at the kitchen table and tried unsuccessfully to not look
at Adam.  "What do you say we head down to Stacy's for lunch and see what
is up with this Layton thing?" asked Adam.  "As long as you put some
clothes on." Clay said through the steam of his tea that was still too hot
to drink. "Well if you insist.  But I'll just be depriving the public."
Adam smiled to no one as his face was hidden from Clay's view.

Adam and Clay had known each other since high school and had lived together
since they were in their twenties. Their home was a small and nondescript
brick building in a lonely section of the city set among other small and
nondescript brick buildings. The original purpose of their building was
unclear but over the past century it had housed a variety of small industry
that had come into and gone out of fashion, the last one being typewriter
sales and repair.

They lived primarily on the second of two floors. The space was open and
light with one large area for kitchen, dining and living each delineated by
a couch, chairs or a table. Clay had purchased or collected most of the
furnishings and had directed the renovation from what had been dark and
crowded office space.

A little after noon, Adam and Clay sat across a Formica table in a tall
backed and dimly lit booth. Stephanie, a woman who looked to be well into
her seventies approached to take their order. A small paper hat sat neatly
on a wavy pile of well coiffed white hair. She wore a light pink uniform
with starched white collar and cuffs and had a clean pleated white apron
tied about her waist. It was a uniform she had worn for years and she still
filled it well. But as she she stood at their table she stooped slightly,
as if to suggest a change in trajectory.

She had worked at the tavern since Adam and Clay were in their teens and
probably long before. Recognizing them she gave them a hearty "Hi fellas"
adding that she had not seen them for a couple of weeks. She took their
orders with the same professional competence that she had always shown, but
the rhythm her performance was slightly stilted giving a sense that she had
begun relying more on patterns of habit than inspiration to get through the
day.

Adam noticed her counterpart, a boy still in college and doing his homework
at the bar between waiting on tables. Behind the bar was Francis, who had
owned the tavern for the past fifteen years and had worked there for ten
years before that. Seeing Adam, he came out from behind the bar where he
still worked serving drinks seven days a week.  As he approached he wiped
his hands on an apron that looked dirty enough to make the act a zero sum
game. In his late fifties, he combed his thin hair over a bald pate.  He
sat down heavily in the booth next to Clay and when asked how things were
going gave his usual answer sighing "Well, I seem to be breaking even." But
there was nothing to suggest that he aspired to anything more. 

"I hear that Layton is buying the building." Adam said. "Yeah, I heard that
as well. I got nothing against him. Doesn't matter too much to me who I pay
the rent check to." "But what if he asks for more rent?" asked Clay. "How
can he?" responded Francis. "There is no way I can afford to pay any more
than I do. Like trying to get blood from a stone." He laughed. Francis
really seemed to believe in his logic and Adam and Clay did not have the
heart to enlighten him.

"What does it say about the pipeline protest?"
asked Clay who had turned away from Adam to pour himself some tea at the
kitchen counter. Adam turned back a few pages, "It looks like the forces
for good are still holding strong. The state halted work on the pipeline
while they review the most recent claims made by native Americans." "That's
not going to hold them up too long."

He fights against common capitalistic aggression. He is not appreciated. He
has a sidekick. He lives like the batman character. He drinks. He is macho
to hide is own insecurity about his sexuality. His super power is mostly
just strength like Captain America. His targets have committed no federal
or state crimes just crimes against the common man. He does not understand
women forever carrying their vestigial glands front and center. He loves
his sidekick and they fall into "low-life" behavior gambling, dirty bars. 

Why do you where those tight clothes. All superheros where tight clothes,
besides I like the way they feel.  You have a suit. I don't understand why
you don't wear it.

Sit one night at home getting drunk. I need a martini. Aren't you supposed
to take care of me. Isn't that what sidekicks are for...to fetch my drinks?
Go fix me a drink. Go fuck yourself. Believe me I have tried. Why do you
always say that. Its not funny. Why do you always tell me to go fuck
myself. Silence.
