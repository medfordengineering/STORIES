She sits all day long pressing keys on the keyboard
staring at the screen and pressing more keys, printing
billions of letters on the screen. Letters formed into
words and words formed into sentences and sent off into
the ether flung into the void half imagined ideas

what of love is real she thought? What of love is
desire and what of desire is real? This was not simply
the existential reduction to nothingness. According to
theories and tests, these were pure attraction and
therefore pure love. The pure love found in their work
was not corrupted by looks, the shape of one's nose,
	guilt, it transcended religion and politics for
	even if there was a disagreement on this level it
	was still there, it could be measured and
	quantified. like distilled water it was so pure
	that it was boring tasteless, dull, persistent and
	obvious. this was not the sort of love her friends
	described or her books described, they were so
	impure that they seemed to be based on impurities.
	and yet this impurities contained no force that
	they could measure. and yet they were mistaken for
	love and desire as if we can become convinced in
	the reality of fools gold. as if it were more
	precious than the real thing, but maybe what we
	found is pure love, but a love that has no value in
	the world of desire. She had never felt that sort
	of love.

	And so desire gives way to and so what is unknown
	gives way to what is known. and so chance gives way
	to prediction. and so uncertainty gives way to
	constant and routine and so fear gives way to
	safety.
