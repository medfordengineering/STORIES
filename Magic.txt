At the end of the show, the magician is six flaming batons. One by one he
places them into stannds forming a semi-circle around him. Finally, he tosses
the last one high into the air and with a dramatic pose points at it, makes a
sound like "shaaa" and it disappears into the night sky. He makes an elaborate
bow, the crowd cheers and he passes his hat among them gathering bills and
change.

At dinner, Seven describes the show to Adam, "This is the third time I have
seen his performance, and every time I see him make the baton disappear, I have
the sense that it is..." "real magic?" Adam finishes her sentence. "Can you
explain how he does it?" asks Seven. "No, but I can't explain just about any of
the magic tricks that I have ever seen. That's why they call it magic." "But
they don't" says Seven. "They don't what?" asks Adam. "They don't call it
magic. Like you said, they call them magic tricks or slights of hand, or
illusions." "It seems odd that we call them magicians, and yet what they do
isn't called magic" 

This was exactly why they were just friends thought Adam. He found these sorts
of abstract conversations irrating and without any real point. They had
dated briefly in college. Ironically, it was the way in which Seven was
different from his other friends that he found attractive and it was why he
still looked forward to their occasional dinners. He sometimes wondered what
she saw in him, but was glad that she saw something, at least, enough to enjoy
his company once in a while.

Seven was born on the seventh day of the seventh month. Her parents were barely
in their twenties when she was born. They had been free spirits back then as
they sometimes said, in tone that seem to their early years together, but at
the same time seemed to mask some regret that their lives had taken a more
conventional path. Seven's bother Josh was born five years later after her
parents married. 

After dinner, Seven walked back to her apartment alone. The evening was cooler
than the day, but still warm. The streets were still damp from an afternoon
rain. The days were already getting shorter and by 7pm it was already dark. The
sidewalks were mostly empty. Some cars drove by. Their occupants mostly
obscured from view. In the apartments she passed, she could see the blue glow
of television screens and imagine young people silently gathered around the box
for the remainder (usual ritual) of the evening. It reminder her of her own
blue screen in her pocket. She had gotten into the habit of turning it off
during dinner and now took it out to check if she had any texts.

The first text was from her mother saying that they were taking Josh to see the
latest Harry Potter movie. The second was from Josh saying that he couldn't
believe Mom and Dad were taking him to see the latest Harry Potter movie. The
third was from Adam saying that he enjoyed dinner and that he thought maybe
text messages were magic because he could not explain how they worked either.
She smiled and felt good about her relationship with Adam. 

When she arrived at her apartment, the second floor of a triple decker, her
roomates Sara and Jenna were watching a movie. On the screen a well dressed man
and woman were engaged in a serious conversation. She sat on the couch next to
Sara. Without turning from the screen, Sara said, "Some old guy called and left
a message." Jenna snorted a small laugh. "I couldn't hear him that well. I
think maybe he was calling from a tin can on a string." added Sara. Jenna let
out a louder laugh.

Seven knew that both Sara and Jenna knew perfectly well who had called, and he
was old. How old, Seven didn't know, but she figured somewhere in his late
sixties. She had met Paul a few months ago in the subway station one morning. 

She is the daughter of powerful magic family. The magician has come to retrieve
her. He knows where she is. They live in the past when magic really existed.
They don't use modern technology like Amish they shun it religously. The
believe in religion and believe that it is the source of their powers. They
inhabit whole towns and look like everyone else. They are afraid she will
reveal their secrets. The old man
