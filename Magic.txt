By the end of the show, he was juggling six flaming batons. Then one by one
he placed them into stands forming a semi-circle around him until he was
throwing just a single baton high into the night sky. As the baton reached
its apex, he pointed both arms at it and struck a pose that looked like
nothing less than what one would expect of a person pretending to be a
wizard and said "Shazah!" and the baton disappeared into the blackness. As
the audience cheered and clapped, he gave an appropriately exaggerated
stage bow and the quickly made his way through the crowd gathering small
bills and change.

At dinner that night, Seven described the performance to Adam, "This is the
third time I have watched his show, and every time I see him make the baton
disappear, I have the sense that it is..." "real magic?" Adam finished her
sentence.  "Can you explain how he does it?" asked Seven. "No, but I can't
explain just about any of the magic tricks that I have ever seen. That's
why they call it magic." "But they don't" said Seven. "They don't what?"
asked Adam. "They don't call it magic. Like you said, they call them magic
tricks or slights of hand, or illusions." "It seems odd that we call them
magicians, and yet what they do isn't called magic" 

Adam was not sure what Seven was getting at, but this was not unusual and
it reminded him of why they were just friends. They had dated briefly in
college. Ironically, it was the way in which Seven was different from his
other friends that he found attractive and it was why he still looked
forward to their occasional dinners. He sometimes wondered what she saw in
him, but was glad that she saw something, at least, enough to enjoy his
company once in a while.

Seven was born on the seventh day of the seventh month in the year 1987.
Her parents had planned to name her Nichole after her father's grandmother,
but on the day she was born, and in an uncharacteristic moment of
spontaneity, her mother suggested they name her Seven. Her suggestion
coincided with an equally uncharacteristic moment of acquiescence on the
part of her father that could most likely be attributed to the site of his
first newborn child, but it was a decision that Seven felt he subsequently
regretted calling her Nicky as much as he called her Seven. Her only
sibling, Josh was born five years later. 

After dinner, Seven walked back to her apartment alone. The sun had set and
the heat of the day had cooled to bearable. Tiny clouds of steam hovered
over the street, the result of a cool afternoon rain colliding with warm
July pavement. The sidewalks were mostly empty as she made her way down
side streets. A few cars drove by, their occupants obscured from view.  In
the apartments she passed, she could see the blue glow of television
screens and imagined young people silently gathered around the box in a
modern human ritual.

She thought of her own blue screen in her pocket. She had gotten into the
habit of turning it off during dinner and now took it out to check if she
had any texts.

The first text was from her mother saying that they were taking Josh to see
the latest Harry Potter movie. The second was from Josh saying that he
couldn't believe he was going with Mom and Dad to see the latest Harry
Potter movie. The third was from Adam saying that he enjoyed dinner and
that he thought maybe text messages were magic because he could not explain
how they worked either. Seven smiled.

When she arrived at her apartment, the second floor of a triple decker, her
roommates Sara and Jenna were watching a movie. On the screen a well
dressed man and woman were engaged in what looked like a serious
conversation. She sat on the couch next to Sara. Without turning from the
screen, Sara said, "Some old guy called and left a message." Jenna snorted
a small laugh. "Though, I couldn't hear him that well. I think maybe his
tin can needs a new string." she added.  Jenna let out an actual laugh.

Seven knew that both Sara and Jenna knew perfectly well who had called, and
he was old. How old, Seven didn't know, but she figured somewhere in his
late sixties. 

She had met Tom a few months ago on the subway platform one morning. They
were both watching a musician perform while everyone else stood lining the
edge of the platform waiting for the next subway train to arrive. As they
watched, riders passed them. A few pausing no longer than the time it took
to fish a dollar from their pocket and toss it into the performer's guitar
case before joining the others on the platform. At the end of the song,
both Tom and Seven applauded. 

And then as the performer began his next song, Tom turned to Seven and
offered her his hand. Uncertain, she accepted. He pulled her next to him
and then moved her across the floor following the rhythm of the music he
lead her dancing on the platform. He gently and confidently pulled and
pushed and dipped and she spun and dipped. At the end they both laughed. A
couple of people turned and smiled but most ignored them.

As the train rolled into the station, Seven broke away not wanting to be
late for work. She turned toward the train and then glanced back to see if
Tom was following her. Tom just stood and lifted his cap and bowed, "A
pleasure to dance with you." he said. He then with his outstretched hand
offered her a slip of paper held out between his index and middle finger.
She took the paper and boarded the train.

The paper was a flyer cut to one quarter of a standard sheet. One it was a
copy of a hand-written invitation to a gathering at Wilson House for the
following Saturday. It advertised a potluck dinner with John Stein reading
from his new novel and discussion to follow. She had never heard of John
Stein, but she figured the number of authors she had never heard was close
to infinite.

She pocketed the flyer and looked around at the passengers on the train. It
was as if nothing out of the ordinary had ever happened. 

When she arrived at her office, Brian was waiting for her. Brain was her
boss and a total jackass, at least that is how Seven thought of him. She
had a hard time imagining anyone thinking any different except for maybe
his mother which she had only met once. She worked as an assistant buyer
for DeMarcos, a local chain of supermarkets. DeMarcos was owned by the
DeMarco family of which Brian was a member. 

Brian was not exactly just standing and waiting for her when she came in
the door, but he conveniently walked out of his office as soon as she
arrived. 

Wilson House
1) Owner is Janice Lucas. She has owned the house for many years. She
participates in protest marches every weekend. She has lots of signs. She
wants Rayburn to close down.
2) Zeke older guy walrus mustache, tall awkward. Wants to be head of the
state bike committee.  but is really shy and can't understand why he is not
been elected. 
3) Tom wants to be in the past.
4) 






They boarded the train together and stood. The seats were all taken, but
the car was not very crowded for a weekday morning. As the train began to
leave the station, Tom addressed Seven. "You are quite good dancer." Seven
admitted that she had taken a few lessons in college, but did not consider
herself good. Tom reached out his hand again and asked, "Well, shall we?"
"I think we might need some music" Seven smiled. "True, but we can't
disappoint them." "Who?" "Why the people gathered here." his arm sweep to
indicate the passengers in their car. "They must be here for a reason." "I
think they are going to work." "Hmm, a clever pretense, but I suspect it is
something else." All of this at a volume that could easily be heard by the
passengers, but no one spoke. 

Well I hate to disappoint them. Who. Them. they seem to have gathered for a
reason. I think they are going to work. 

They must have gathered here for a reason. They are going to work. Ahh but
a pretense. clever pretense, but I think it is something else. You think
they are here to watch us dance? No I think they have gathered for a party. 


turned to sugar filled sounds box plugged into their
boxes of sugar 

you see, they think I am going to ask them for money, and there would be
nothing wrong in that. But as it is, I sucking on their sugar. Sounds and
sites distilled to their crack cocaine.

A full compliment of humanity before us and no song

Seven and asked, "Are you feeling self
conscious." "A little." she laughed.  "Well, don't worry" Tom said,
sweeping his hand to indicate all the other people in the car. "None of
them to can see you." He leaned closer to her and said, To them we are
completely invisible. Why, I could run stark naked up and down the car and
no one would even notice. Seven laughed, well I doubt that..but I am not
daring you.


Tom pointed to the 
As they boarded the train, he asked her to come to his house for dinner. He
lived in a cooperative house.


Tom wants to go back in time. He is obsessed with the past..any time. Adam
and Seven get to know him. They do crazy things. Adam is uncomfortable.
Seven reveals her suspicion about the magician. They decide to recruit him
to take them into the past.



She is the daughter of powerful magic family. The magician has come to retrieve
her. He knows where she is. They live in the past when magic really existed.
They don't use modern technology like Amish they shun it religously. The
believe in religion and believe that it is the source of their powers. They
inhabit whole towns and look like everyone else. They are afraid she will
reveal their secrets. The old man

Why did anyone who aspired to any sort of intellectual status feel guilty
about this box. They would deny watching it as if they honestly believed
this. The whole country had moved into a sense of denial as if it were an
epidemic. But had it always been this way? Did people always feel a
conflict between their actual lives and their perceived lives. Was modern
life just filled with more guilty pleasures. 

Even the dog ignores the television. The dogs life seems changed little
since his domestication. In the modern world his freedom is more restricted
but his interaction with the world remains the same.  He sleeps. He eats.
He sleeps without regard for modern light. Still finding his rythm of the
sun. Television sets have not effect on the dog. He rides in cars, but
without intention or car. It is not a great machine of conveyance, but
simply a place to be like any other. He is equally oblivious to his own
mortality yet still shares our instinct for survival.
