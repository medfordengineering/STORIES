By the end of the show, he was juggling six flaming batons. Then one by one
he placed them into stands forming a semi-circle around him until he was
throwing just a single baton high into the night sky. As the baton reached
its apex, he pointed both arms at it and struck a pose that looked like
nothing less than what one would expect of a person pretending to be a
wizard and said "Shazah!" and the baton disappeared into the blackness. As
the audience cheered and clapped, he gave an appropriately exaggerated
stage bow and then quickly made his way through the crowd gathering small
bills and change into his outstretched cap. 

At dinner that night, Seven described the performance to Adam, "This is the
third time I have watched his show, and every time I see him make the baton
disappear, I have the sense that it is..." "real magic?" Adam finished her
sentence.  "Can you explain how he does it?" asked Seven. "No, but I can't
explain just about any of the magic tricks that I have ever seen. That's
why they call it magic." "But they don't" said Seven. "They don't what?"
asked Adam. "They don't call it magic. Like you said, they call them magic
tricks or slights of hand, or illusions." "It seems odd that we call them
magicians, and yet what they do isn't called magic" 

Adam was not sure what Seven was getting at, but this was typical and it
reminded him of why they were just friends. They had dated briefly in
college. Ironically, it was the way in which Seven was different from his
other friends that he found attractive and it was why he still looked
forward to their occasional dinners. He sometimes wondered what she saw in
him, but was glad that she saw something, at least, enough to enjoy his
company once in a while.

Seven was born on the seventh day of the seventh month in the year 1987.
Her parents had planned to name her Nichole after her father's grandmother,
but on the day she was born, and in an uncharacteristic moment of
spontaneity, her mother suggested they name her Seven. Her suggestion
coincided with an equally uncharacteristic moment of acquiescence on the
part of her father that could most likely be attributed to the site of his
first newborn child, but it was a decision that Seven felt he subsequently
regretted calling her Nicky as much as he called her Seven. Her only
sibling, Josh was born five years later. 

After dinner, Seven walked back to her apartment alone. The sun had set and
the heat of the day had cooled to bearable. A cloud of steam hovered over
the street, the result of a cool afternoon rain colliding with warm July
pavement. The sidewalks were mostly empty as she made her way down a series
of side streets. A few cars drove by, their occupants obscured from view.
In the apartments she passed, she could see the blue glow of television
screens and imagined young people silently gathered around the box in the
modern human ritual.

She thought of her own blue screen in her pocket. She had gotten into the
habit of turning it off during dinner and now took it out to check if she
had any texts.

The first text was from her mother saying that they were taking Josh to see
the latest Harry Potter movie. The second was from Josh saying that he
couldn't believe he was going with Mom and Dad to see the latest Harry
Potter movie. The third was from Adam saying that he enjoyed dinner and
that he thought maybe text messages were magic because he could not explain
how they worked either. Seven smiled.

When she arrived at her apartment, the second floor of a triple decker, her
roommates Sara and Jenna were watching a movie. On the screen a well
dressed man and woman were engaged in what looked like a serious
conversation. She sat on the couch next to Sara. Without turning from the
screen, Sara said, "Some old guy called and left a message." Jenna snorted
a small laugh. "I couldn't hear him that well. I think maybe his tin can
needs a new string." At this, Jenna let out an actual laugh.

Seven knew that both Sara and Jenna knew perfectly well who had called, and
he was old. How old, Seven didn't know, but she figured somewhere in his
late sixties. She had made the mistake of telling them about him and his
views on modern technology. She knew their chiding was good natured, but
she still wished they had at least tried to understand.

She had met Tom a couple of weeks ago on the subway platform one morning.
They were both watching a musician perform. Everyone else stood, their
backs to them, lining the edge of the platform waiting for the next subway
train to arrive. As they watched, more riders arrived, passing them on
their way to the platform. A few paused, but no longer than the time it
took to fish a dollar from their pocket and toss it into the performer's
guitar case before joining the others.  At the end of the song, both Tom
and Seven applauded. 

The musician smiled at each of them and bowed his head. The start of his
next song was drowned out by the sound of the arriving train. Seven and Tom
both turned to board the train. They stood together near the door as it
closed. As the train left the station, Tom looked around at the people in
their car. Most sat staring straight ahead, wires trailing from their ears
and into their pockets and bags. 

"Look at them" he said gesturing toward the passengers and in a voice that
made no attempt to protect the subjects of his disdain "Why couldn't they
have just stopped and listened...for just a moment?" he said his hands and
arms expressing exasperation. "What other task was so important? Did they
not see him?" He turned to Seven. "A fellow man stands and performs his art
for their benefit, asking nothing of them."

Seven laughed both at what he said and the boldness of his manner. Yet no
one on the train risked a glance in their direction. "They might have felt
obliged to contribute." she responded.

"But they did contribute." Tom complained loudly. "You saw them as they
walked by tossing him a dollar as if he barely existed." He shook his head.
"And then they continued on, turning their back to him." He paused as an
automated voice announced the next stop. "But you stood there, why?"

"I am not sure." said Seven. "I guess I saw you there first. Maybe I felt
sorry for him. Maybe I felt sorry for you."

"But at least you felt a something." he said finally seeming satisfied.
They stood next to each other in their own thoughts for a moment.

"But what about the music?" he asked. "Did you enjoy it? Did you take any
pleasure in hearing him play?" 

"Sure, I enjoyed it." She responded. "He has a nice voice. I have seen him
there before, but this was the first time I stopped to really listen." She
thought for a moment. "I mean, maybe they just did not want to stop. Maybe
they just don't like his type of music.  Should we stop and listen to every
person who decides to perform in public?"

"They did not want. They did not want!" Tom repeated his voice resuming its
earlier volume. "Who cares what they did not want? A society of people
walking around not doing whatever 'they did not want' is not a society. It
is less than a herd of sheep who at the very least appreciate the
importance of the herd."

Seven laughed again. "How do you know what sheep appreciate?" She said. Tom
smiled. "Besides," Seven added, "they were following the herd. It was him
who was breaking with convention."

"Look at them." he said again turning away from her and toward the
passengers. "At least sheep graze on grass in all its natural glory and
imperfection. They just sit there suckling on a some...some facsimile of
the human experience.  Refined and sterilized, its only purpose to trigger
a pathetically saccharin response in their sad Pavlovian brains." 

"Well, I can't argue with you there." Seven laughed.

The train arrived at her stop. "Oh, this my stop. My name is Seven." She
extended her hand hurriedly. "It was very nice to meet you." "I'm Tom.
Very nice to meet you as well." He handed her a note that he had pulled
from his bag.  She took the note and left. The note turned out to be a
flyer cut from one quarter of a standard sheet.  On it was a copy of a
hand-written invitation to a gathering at Wilson House Coop for the
following Saturday.  It advertised a potluck dinner with John Stein reading
from his new novel and a discussion to follow.  She had never heard of John
Stein, but she figured the number of authors she had never heard of
approached infinity.

When she arrived at her office, Brian was waiting for her. Brain was her
boss and a total jackass, at least that is how Seven thought of him. She
had a hard time imagining anyone thinking any different except for maybe
his mother which she had only met once. She worked as an assistant buyer
for Artinos, a local chain of supermarkets. Artinos was owned by the Artino
family of which Brian was a member. 

Brian was not exactly just standing and waiting for her when she came in
the door, but he walked out of his office as soon as she arrived and she
suspected it was not a coincidence. He asked if she had reviewed the
proposal from VanNess for their new line of chips. Chips were important.
They came under the category of "Salty Foods", a major food category in the
grocery industry as measured by sales, dwarfed only by soda. These were
just some of the facts that made her job depressing.

"No. I looked at it yesterday, but will have a report for you by this
afternoon." She said, closing the distance between them by a few inches,
but only to accentuate their difference in height, a difference in which
she held the advantage. "And don't worry, I will break it down into simple
language that I suspect even you can understand" she thought.  She was
honestly not sure why she disliked Brian so much. Her mother would have
called him a milksop.  She was not sure exactly what the term meant but it
was how her mother described her first boyfriend, though only after they
broken up and only when pressed for a description. It had made them both
laugh at the time. 

When she got to her desk she immediately called Adam. "What do you want?"
he said. "Don't I even get a hello?" she responded. "Sorry." he said. But
thought a call from Seven often meant trouble, particularly this early on a
workday morning. "What are you doing on Friday?" she asked. "On Friday
...well, let me see.." "Nothing" she cut him off. "Does this involve
magic?" he asked.  "Huh, good question..." she paused for serious
consideration and immediately Adam regretted asking the question. Finding
no purchase for this new line of thinking she responded "We are going to a
party." "Oh" he said and then "Do I want to go to a party?" "Yes" she
laughed. "It will be fun. Meet me at 7pm outside of Mikes in Franklin."

They found the house just outside of Franklin Square. The front yard looked
like it had been allowed to progress without human intervention for some
time, so they made their way down the drive toward the back of the house.
It was only at this point that Adam asked, "Do you actually know these
people?" "No" said Seven. "Oh wonderful" Adam sighed as he noticed lights
on on the first floor and heard the sounds of people enjoying themselves.

Entering the rear porch they could see a large stack of hand-painted
protest signs leaning upside down against a wall. Simple black lettering on
white background, their statements of discontent covering a variety of
themes. Battered and dirty, they appeared to be veterans of more than a few
campaigns. 

They entered a small kitchen, warm and busy with people. Seven held the
boxed pie that she had picked up at an Artinos on her way to the party. As
they made their way through the crowd, Adam leaned over to Seven and said,
"Just don't leave me alone."

In the living room there were more people talking in content sets of twos
and threes. Seven looked but could not find Tom among them. She decided
that she would just have to tell Tom that she brought the pie and removed
it from its packaging before placing on a table between Tupperware
containers of homemade salads and baked goods.

Adam, meanwhile filled a small plate with a couple of brownies and some
gingersnaps. He suggested that Seven do the same and then they make for the
exit. Ignoring him, Seven interrupted a conversation between two young men
and asked if either of them knew of someone named Tom adding that he had
given her the invitation. One of the men looked around the room saying,
"Well he should be here." Not spotting him either, he said "Well, I guess
he must be in his room. Do you know where it is?" He directed them to the
back stairs and said it was room number four on the second floor. 

Adam, resigned to seeing the evening through with Seven, followed her
upstairs. The doors on the second floor were mostly numbered. They stopped
in front of the one with a red number four painted neatly in the middle of
a green square. She knocked. There was no answer. She knocked again. "Who
is it?" came a lazy and distracted reply. "It's Seven. We met on the train
platform listening to music together." "Uh-Huh" he responded, validating
the information but giving it no additional merit. "Can we come?" she
asked. "The door is open." 

Seven and Adam entered into a room that was only slightly larger than the
single bed in which Tom lay. The bed was on a raised platform neatly
constructed from lumber and braces. Beneath it sat a small desk and chair.
There was just enough floor space for Seven and Adam to stand with the door
shut behind them. Tom lay staring at the wall, his child-like body
comfortably framed in the small bed. At the foot of his bed a sleeping cat
acknowledged their presence through eyes that opened and blinked a few
times and then went back to sleep.

"Tom. Hi. This is Adam" said Seven introducing her friend. "Hi" Tom said
turning his gaze for a moment to acknowledge the introduction. Seven could
see that Tom was staring a picture on his wall. She could tell that it was
a photograph taken of a city street. She could make out people and what
looked like a street car. It looked old. "What are you looking at?" she
asked. A photograph he said. The two women are talking to the grocer. He
owns the store. It is early on a Saturday and he is just opening up. You
see all the fruit placed in wooden boxes out front. You can see bins of
cherries so you know it is July. The prices written by hand in chalk on
placards. Look the name of the store, written on the awning is his name.
The women come here every Saturday. They know the grocer well. They are
friends. They have walked there together as they do every Saturday morning.
The grocer wears a white button down shirt and tie.

Just through the door you can make out a young boy. He works for Mr.
Stanski. He is a boy from the neighborhood. He is also dressed in white
button down shirt under his apron. 

In the street are lots of people. You can see two men walking together.
Both in white shirts and ties and jackets. No need to stand out. No need to
shout look at me. I am an individual. They belong to the community. Any
differences in person and personality can be discerned through
conversation.  It is not oppression it is freedom.

A street car passes them headed for Winthrop St. downtown. The street car
is filled with passengers. Men wearing ties and women in dresses.  


What do you do. I work in financial services. But what is your job. I am an
analyst for an investment firm. So what does that job entail. I research
companies and decide if people should invest in them. And how do you
decide? Well there are models we use and I also...I just sort..well, I just
decide. So you are no really sure even what you do and yet people believe
you. Yeah, it is a little disconcerting. Do you know why a company is worth
what someone says it is worth? I guess because people believe it. 

There was a time when the world was no more complicated than a typewriter.
Certainly an impressive and complex piece of machinery made with levers and
hinges, slides, for not only typing letters in both lower and upper case,
but setting tabs and returns, adjusting key pressure and torque. And a
device that any single human could understand simply by visually following
the chain of events from part of the machine to another. Nothing needed to
be taken for granted.

It is as if a fog has moved into and is here to stay. It sits murky between
us or inside all of what makes our world work. I take on faith that a
button I press here results in an event over there. I take on faith that a
man landed on the moon. I take on faith that inside a box more than a
million operations happen in a microsecond. A number far larger than I can
possibly comprehend without faith in a time equally as abstract. I can see
one second. I can see a quarter of a second, but I cannot see one millionth
of a second. It is all incomprehensible and taken on faith. You could tell
me that elves in habit these devices around us and I would have no more
reason to doubt you. It might as well be magic. 

He saw a squirrel outside his window eating a pear. Squirrels did not have
to worry about their diet or what they ate. It was as if perfection was
staring at us every day and we refused to see it. It seemed so obvious that
he wondered if he was really the only person who did not see it. Maybe this
was all just a game waiting for him to realize.

What do you want to do? Go back in time. It was then that they noticed the
pictures in his room. He had been staring at one on the wall. It showed.
Have you not been getting enough sleep. Oh no, I have been getting lots of
sleep. But too much sleep can make you tired.

"We came for the potluck." Oh yes, I
invited you didn't I.  Yes and this is Adam.  Pleased to meet you Adam. So
why are you not downstairs?  Tom is slight.


Why are you downstairs. I well, I was going. Oh I
don't know. Don't know what?


I engage people I don't know. It is the only way that I can remember that I
exist. It was my therapists idea.

1) Owner is Janice Lucas. She has owned the house for many years. She
participates in protest marches every weekend. She has lots of signs. She
wants Rayburn to close down.
2) Zeke older guy walrus mustache, tall awkward. Wants to be head of the
state bike committee.  but is really shy and can't understand why he is not
been elected. 
3) Tom wants to be in the past.
4) 


"What do you want?" came
a distracted reply. "It's Seven.  We met on the subway last week. You
invited me to this party." 

"Oh...uh...hmm." Came Tom's reply. "We watched the man playing guitar
together." she added. "Yes. I remember." Tom said as if this new
information was no more pertinent than the previous information. "Can we
come in?" she asked. There was a pause and then "Oh, I don't know." 

"You don't know?" Seven laughed. "It's generally not the sort of decision
that needs much contemplation." she added. There was no response from Tom.
After a few seconds, Seven looked at Adam, shrugged her shoulders and
turned to leave.

Then they heard what sounded like "Okay." "What?" Seven asked. "You can
come in." said Tom.



Do you want to marry him? Ha Ha. He doesn't watch television. Has he ever
seen television? I mean it is pretty great. Nah he was born before
television even existed...then realized this was probably true.



They boarded the train together and stood. The seats were all taken, but
the car was not very crowded for a weekday morning. As the train began to
leave the station, Tom addressed Seven. "You are quite good dancer." Seven
admitted that she had taken a few lessons in college, but did not consider
herself good. Tom reached out his hand again and asked, "Well, shall we?"
"I think we might need some music" Seven smiled. "True, but we can't
disappoint them." "Who?" "Why the people gathered here." his arm sweep to
indicate the passengers in their car. "They must be here for a reason." "I
think they are going to work." "Hmm, a clever pretense, but I suspect it is
something else." All of this at a volume that could easily be heard by the
passengers, but no one spoke. 

Well I hate to disappoint them. Who. Them. they seem to have gathered for a
reason. I think they are going to work. 

They must have gathered here for a reason. They are going to work. Ahh but
a pretense. clever pretense, but I think it is something else. You think
they are here to watch us dance? No I think they have gathered for a party. 


turned to sugar filled sounds box plugged into their
boxes of sugar 

you see, they think I am going to ask them for money, and there would be
nothing wrong in that. But as it is, I sucking on their sugar. Sounds and
sites distilled to their crack cocaine.

A full compliment of humanity before us and no song

Seven and asked, "Are you feeling self
conscious." "A little." she laughed.  "Well, don't worry" Tom said,
sweeping his hand to indicate all the other people in the car. "None of
them to can see you." He leaned closer to her and said, To them we are
completely invisible. Why, I could run stark naked up and down the car and
no one would even notice. Seven laughed, well I doubt that..but I am not
daring you.


Tom pointed to the 
As they boarded the train, he asked her to come to his house for dinner. He
lived in a cooperative house.


Tom wants to go back in time. He is obsessed with the past..any time. Adam
and Seven get to know him. They do crazy things. Adam is uncomfortable.
Seven reveals her suspicion about the magician. They decide to recruit him
to take them into the past.



She is the daughter of powerful magic family. The magician has come to retrieve
her. He knows where she is. They live in the past when magic really existed.
They don't use modern technology like Amish they shun it religously. The
believe in religion and believe that it is the source of their powers. They
inhabit whole towns and look like everyone else. They are afraid she will
reveal their secrets. The old man    

***
Why did anyone who aspired to any sort of intellectual status feel guilty
about this box. They would deny watching it as if they honestly believed
this. The whole country had moved into a sense of denial as if it were an
epidemic. But had it always been this way? Did people always feel a
conflict between their actual lives and their perceived lives. Was modern
life just filled with more guilty pleasures. 

Even the dog ignores the television. The dogs life seems changed little
since his domestication. In the modern world his freedom is more restricted
but his interaction with the world remains the same.  He sleeps. He eats.
He sleeps without regard for modern light. Still finding his rythm of the
sun. Television sets have not effect on the dog. He rides in cars, but
without intention or car. It is not a great machine of conveyance, but
simply a place to be like any other. He is equally oblivious to his own
mortality yet still shares our instinct for survival. 


Why couldn't they just
stand there and show some respect for his work? Why did you stand there?"
Maybe they don;t want to listen. Don't want to? Don't want to? what does
want have to do with it?  What is there desire compared to the needs of the
community. What are they cows. Dulling following where ever they find grass
to eat. Even cows have more of a sense of community. I want candy, must eat
candy. It is sickening.

"Look at them." in way that made no attempt to hide is wonder and shaking
his head. "There is something they don't get. Something missing from their
experience or their desire for experience. Why don't the crave a sense of
connection between human beings? What is it they don't get? What has
happened to our sense of human connection? A man plays a song with all of
its imperfection, but it is not the song they have heard before. What is
wrong with them?  I don't understand.

Why couldn't they just listen? Why couldn't they just stand there and show
respect for his work. They had all probably paid money to see far less
talented musicians. Is it even about talent. He made an effort to
entertain. But what if it is not entertaining? What if it is not what I
want. Not all of them but some of them. Do we all have to stop and listen
when someone plays a song? But it is not just about the music. With a
machine yes. There would be no reason to listen to a record you did not
like, but this is a human. We have boiled down our experience to what we
like and what we don't. but we have forgotten that it is not just about the
music. it is about the human experience.


Why were you standing there? I don't know she thought. It just seemed sad
to pass. Though I felt self-conscious for doing so. She had not felt
comfortable.

Of course you did. The heard had 

Maybe they just didn't want to listen? Maybe they did not like the song he
was playing. 

Not like? The world is not about personal likes and dislikes. It is about
the common experience. Since when are we allowed to simply follow our likes
and dislikes and what makes this right or good or even fulfilling?



"Look at them. They are terrified of even the slightest hint of human..."
he paused and turned to her, "disorder." For a moment neither of them
spoke. Self-consciously, Seven fingered the earbuds in her own pocket. 


He now turned to address her directly. "Do you know there was a time, when
being a musician was a viable career choice like being a plumber or an
electrician. In 1926, over 20 thousand musicians worked in movie theater
pits and now a musician is relegated to the role of beggar, performing only
for the sympathy of the public." 

CHANGE

"Do you play an instrument?" Seven asked. "Sadly no." said Tom. "I have
tried, but seem incapable of the art. Oh, I can pluck out a song okay, but
am terminally incapable of actually playing music." 

Tom asked her if she played any instruments and by the time the train came
to her stop, she found herself telling him an obscure, though suddenly
poignant, story about how she had slept through her own eighth birthday
party.
