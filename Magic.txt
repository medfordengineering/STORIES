By the end of the show, he was juggling six flaming batons. Then one by one
he placed them into stands forming a semi-circle around him until he was
throwing just a single baton high into the night sky. As the baton reached
its apex, he pointed both arms at it and struck a pose that looked like
nothing less than what one would expect of a person pretending to be a
wizard and said "Shazah!" and the baton disappeared into the blackness. As
the audience cheered and clapped, he gave an appropriately exaggerated
stage bow and the quickly made his way through the crowd gathering small
bills and change.

At dinner that night, Seven described the performance to Adam, "This is the
third time I have watched his show, and every time I see him make the baton
disappear, I have the sense that it is..." "real magic?" Adam finished her
sentence.  "Can you explain how he does it?" asked Seven. "No, but I can't
explain just about any of the magic tricks that I have ever seen. That's
why they call it magic." "But they don't" said Seven. "They don't what?"
asked Adam. "They don't call it magic. Like you said, they call them magic
tricks or slights of hand, or illusions." "It seems odd that we call them
magicians, and yet what they do isn't called magic" 

Adam was not sure what Seven was getting at, but this was typical and it
reminded him of why they were just friends. They had dated briefly in
college. Ironically, it was the way in which Seven was different from his
other friends that he found attractive and it was why he still looked
forward to their occasional dinners. He sometimes wondered what she saw in
him, but was glad that she saw something, at least, enough to enjoy his
company once in a while.

Seven was born on the seventh day of the seventh month in the year 1987.
Her parents had planned to name her Nichole after her father's grandmother,
but on the day she was born, and in an uncharacteristic moment of
spontaneity, her mother suggested they name her Seven. Her suggestion
coincided with an equally uncharacteristic moment of acquiescence on the
part of her father that could most likely be attributed to the site of his
first newborn child, but it was a decision that Seven felt he subsequently
regretted calling her Nicky as much as he called her Seven. Her only
sibling, Josh was born five years later. 

After dinner, Seven walked back to her apartment alone. The sun had set and
the heat of the day had cooled to bearable. A cloud of steam hovered
over the street, the result of a cool afternoon rain colliding with warm
July pavement. The sidewalks were mostly empty as she made her way down
side streets. A few cars drove by, their occupants obscured from view.  In
the apartments she passed, she could see the blue glow of television
screens and imagined young people silently gathered around the box in the
modern human ritual.

She thought of her own blue screen in her pocket. She had gotten into the
habit of turning it off during dinner and now took it out to check if she
had any texts.

The first text was from her mother saying that they were taking Josh to see
the latest Harry Potter movie. The second was from Josh saying that he
couldn't believe he was going with Mom and Dad to see the latest Harry
Potter movie. The third was from Adam saying that he enjoyed dinner and
that he thought maybe text messages were magic because he could not explain
how they worked either. Seven smiled.

When she arrived at her apartment, the second floor of a triple decker, her
roommates Sara and Jenna were watching a movie. On the screen a well
dressed man and woman were engaged in what looked like a serious
conversation. She sat on the couch next to Sara. Without turning from the
screen, Sara said, "Some old guy called and left a message." Jenna snorted
a small laugh. "Though, I couldn't hear him that well. I think maybe his
tin can needs a new string." she added.  Jenna then let out an actual
laugh.

Seven knew that both Sara and Jenna knew perfectly well who had called, and
he was old. How old, Seven didn't know, but she figured somewhere in his
late sixties. 

She had met Tom a couple of weeks ago on the subway platform one morning.
They were both watching a musician perform while everyone else stood, their
backs to them, lining the edge of the platform waiting for the next subway
train to arrive. As they watched, more riders arrived, passing them. A few
paused, but no longer than the time it took to fish a dollar from their
pocket and toss it into the performer's guitar case before joining the
others on the platform.  At the end of the song, both Tom and Seven
applauded. 

The musician smiled and bowed his head. The start of his next song was
drowned out by the sound of the train arriving on the platform. Seven and
Tom both turned to board the train and stood together near the door as it
closed. As the train left the station, Tom looked around at the people in
their car. Most sat staring straight ahead, wires trailing from their ears
and into their pockets and bags. "Look at them" he said in a voice that
made no attempt to protect the subjects of his disdain. He gestured toward
each passenger, as if they were no more than curiosities. "They sit there
suckling on some facsimile of the human experience. How can they listen
over and over again to the same sterile version of a song designed to
trigger some pathetically saccharin response in their sad Pavlovian
brains." Seven laughed both at what he said and nervously at the boldness
of his manner. 

"Look at them. They are terrified of even the slightest hint of
human..." he paused, "disorder."

He now turned to address her directly. "Do you know there was a time, when
being a musician was a viable career choice like being a plumber or an
electrician. In 1926, over 20 thousand musicians worked in movie theater
pits and now a musician is relegated to the role of beggar, performing only
for the sympathy of the public." 

"Do you play an instrument?" Seven asked. "Sadly no." said Tom. "I have
tried, but seem incapable of the art. Oh, I can pluck out a song okay, but
am terminally incapable of actually playing music." 

Tom asked her if she played any instruments and by the time the train came
to her stop, she found herself telling him a story about how she had almost
slept through her own tenth birthday party.

Just before she exiting the train, Tom handed her a note that he had pulled
from his bag and said, "Come to a party." She took the note waved goodbye.
The note turned out to be a flyer cut to one quarter of a standard sheet.
On it was a copy of a hand-written invitation to a gathering at Wilson
House Coop for the following Saturday. It advertised a potluck dinner with
John Stein reading from his new novel and discussion to follow.  She had
never heard of John Stein, but she figured the number of authors she had
never heard was close to infinite.

She pocketed the flyer and looked around at the passengers on the train. It
was as if nothing out of the ordinary had ever happened. 

When she arrived at her office, Brian was waiting for her. Brain was her
boss and a total jackass, at least that is how Seven thought of him. She
had a hard time imagining anyone thinking any different except for maybe
his mother which she had only met once. She worked as an assistant buyer
for Artinos, a local chain of supermarkets. Artinos was owned by the Artino
family of which Brian was a member. 

Brian was not exactly just standing and waiting for her when she came in
the door, but he walked out of his office as soon as she arrived and she
suspected it was not a coincidence. He asked if she had reviewed the
proposal from VanNess for their new line of chips. Chips were important.
They came under the category of "Salty Foods", a major food category in the
grocery industry as measured by sales, though still dwarfed by soda. These
were just some of the facts that made her job depressing.

"No. I looked at it yesterday, but will have a report for you by this
afternoon." She smiled with just the slightest hint of exasperation. "And
don't worry, I will break it down into simple language that I suspect even
you can understand" she thought.  She was honestly not sure why she
disliked Brian so much. Her mother would have called him a milksop. She was
not sure exactly what the term meant but it was how her mother described
her first boyfriend, though only after they broken up and only when pressed
for a definition. It had made them both laugh at the time. 

When she got to her desk she immediately called Adam. "What do you want?"
was his reply. "Don't I even get a hello?" she responded. "Sorry." he said,
but a call from Seven often meant trouble, particularly this early on a
workday morning. "What are you doing on Friday?" she asked. "On Friday
...well, let me see.." "Nothing" she cut him off. "Does this involve
magic?" he asked. "Huh, good question..." she paused for serious
consideration and immediately Adam regretted asking the question. Finding
no purchase for this new line of thinking she responded "We are going to a
party." "Oh" he said and then "Do I want to go to a party?" "Yes" she
laughed. "It will be fun. Meet me at 7pm outside of Mikes in Franklin."

They found the house just outside of Franklin Square. The front yard looked
like it had been allowed to progress without human intervention for some
time, so they made their way down the drive toward the back of the house.
It was only at this point that Adam asked, "Do you actually know these
people?" "No" said Seven. "Oh wonderful" Adam sighed as he noticed the
lights on on the first floor and heard the sounds of people enjoying
themselves.

Entering the rear porch they could see a large stack of hand-painted
protest signs leaning against a wall. Most were just simple black lettering
on a white background. Though partially obscured they could make out the
words "guns", "womb" and "nuclear". They looked like they were veterans of
more than a few campaigns.

They entered a small kitchen busy with people. Seven held the day-old pie
that she had picked up for free at an Artinos on her way to the party.
Discounted or free food was one of the few perks of her job. As they made
their way through the crowd, Adam leaned over to Seven and said, "Just
don't leave me alone."

In the living room, also small and crowded, Seven looked but could not find
Tom. She decided that she would just have to tell Tom that she brought the
pie and removed it from its packaging before placing on a table next to
Tupperware container of homemade Tabouli salad.

Adam, meanwhile had filled a small plate with brownies and gingersnaps. He
suggested that Seven do the same and then they make for the exit. Ignoring
him, Seven entered uninvited a conversation between two young women and
asked if either of them knew someone named Tom. The shorter of the two
pointed to a woman across the room who might have been in her thirties and
said "She lives here and will probably know."

"Hi...Kelly" Seven interrupted, "We are looking for Tom." Kelly looked
around the room. "Hmm" she said to herself, "Well, I guess he must be in
his room. Do you know where it is?" She directed them to the back stairs
and said it was number four on the second floor. 

Adam resigned to seeing the evening through with Seven followed her
upstairs. Seven stopped at the door with the number 7 painted in red on
green in the middle. She paused to and then knocked. There was no answer so
she knocked again. "What do you want?" came a tired reply.  "It's
Seven...we danced on subway platform." Adam who had been let in on none of
this looked at Seven.

"Oh...uh yes come in." Seven and Adam entered into a room that was only
slightly larger than the single bed in which Tom sat pinching the bridge of
his nose. His bed was on a raised platform so that underneath fit a small
desk and chair. "We came for the potluck." Oh yes, I invited you didn't I.
Yes and this is Adam. Pleased to meet you Adam. So why are you not
downstairs? 


Why are you downstairs. I well, I was going. Oh I
don't know. Don't know what?


I engage people I don't know. It is the only way that I can remember that I
exist. It was my therapists idea.

1) Owner is Janice Lucas. She has owned the house for many years. She
participates in protest marches every weekend. She has lots of signs. She
wants Rayburn to close down.
2) Zeke older guy walrus mustache, tall awkward. Wants to be head of the
state bike committee.  but is really shy and can't understand why he is not
been elected. 
3) Tom wants to be in the past.
4) 



Do you want to marry him? Ha Ha. He doesn't watch television. Has he ever
seen television? I mean it is pretty great. Nah he was born before
television even existed...then realized this was probably true.



They boarded the train together and stood. The seats were all taken, but
the car was not very crowded for a weekday morning. As the train began to
leave the station, Tom addressed Seven. "You are quite good dancer." Seven
admitted that she had taken a few lessons in college, but did not consider
herself good. Tom reached out his hand again and asked, "Well, shall we?"
"I think we might need some music" Seven smiled. "True, but we can't
disappoint them." "Who?" "Why the people gathered here." his arm sweep to
indicate the passengers in their car. "They must be here for a reason." "I
think they are going to work." "Hmm, a clever pretense, but I suspect it is
something else." All of this at a volume that could easily be heard by the
passengers, but no one spoke. 

Well I hate to disappoint them. Who. Them. they seem to have gathered for a
reason. I think they are going to work. 

They must have gathered here for a reason. They are going to work. Ahh but
a pretense. clever pretense, but I think it is something else. You think
they are here to watch us dance? No I think they have gathered for a party. 


turned to sugar filled sounds box plugged into their
boxes of sugar 

you see, they think I am going to ask them for money, and there would be
nothing wrong in that. But as it is, I sucking on their sugar. Sounds and
sites distilled to their crack cocaine.

A full compliment of humanity before us and no song

Seven and asked, "Are you feeling self
conscious." "A little." she laughed.  "Well, don't worry" Tom said,
sweeping his hand to indicate all the other people in the car. "None of
them to can see you." He leaned closer to her and said, To them we are
completely invisible. Why, I could run stark naked up and down the car and
no one would even notice. Seven laughed, well I doubt that..but I am not
daring you.


Tom pointed to the 
As they boarded the train, he asked her to come to his house for dinner. He
lived in a cooperative house.


Tom wants to go back in time. He is obsessed with the past..any time. Adam
and Seven get to know him. They do crazy things. Adam is uncomfortable.
Seven reveals her suspicion about the magician. They decide to recruit him
to take them into the past.



She is the daughter of powerful magic family. The magician has come to retrieve
her. He knows where she is. They live in the past when magic really existed.
They don't use modern technology like Amish they shun it religously. The
believe in religion and believe that it is the source of their powers. They
inhabit whole towns and look like everyone else. They are afraid she will
reveal their secrets. The old man

Why did anyone who aspired to any sort of intellectual status feel guilty
about this box. They would deny watching it as if they honestly believed
this. The whole country had moved into a sense of denial as if it were an
epidemic. But had it always been this way? Did people always feel a
conflict between their actual lives and their perceived lives. Was modern
life just filled with more guilty pleasures. 

Even the dog ignores the television. The dogs life seems changed little
since his domestication. In the modern world his freedom is more restricted
but his interaction with the world remains the same.  He sleeps. He eats.
He sleeps without regard for modern light. Still finding his rythm of the
sun. Television sets have not effect on the dog. He rides in cars, but
without intention or car. It is not a great machine of conveyance, but
simply a place to be like any other. He is equally oblivious to his own
mortality yet still shares our instinct for survival.
