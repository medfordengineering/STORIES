go somewhere at night? Maybe when darkness fell complete, he imagined, they
just slowly came to a halt, like windup creatures whose springs had finally
exhausted enough energy that they could no longer overcome the friction of
their gears, and stood resting motionless until their caretaker came round
before dawn to wind them back up again.

The gun toting wack job who wishes for Armageddon to bring some meaning
to his life.


She never entered a house quietly. Never just came in a put her things away
and went about her business. Immediately upon entering she would shout
Hello, anyone home.

he watched his cat clean himself. The same routine each day. The cat ate,
sleep and chased wild animals. The routine never varied. Nor did the
routine of his parents or grandparents. In fact, you could go back 3000
years and you would find cats behaving just as they did today. 


Having no previous buffer for these sorts of emotions,

Siting on the bus he is relaxed while others are

the time will not pass too quickly.

The towns that even as they built them and designed
them and created roads to reach them and enable more of
them, they knew even then that they themselves would
never live in them. Never could live in them. Found the
thought of living in them repulsive. So why were they
surprised when a whole generation of people who had
lived in them also felt the same way. The only surprise
should have been that it took them so long.

After his one great work of art he could never make
anything else that garned much interest. His one work
hung in the national gallery, and people always stopped
and admired it. but could never remember his name. and
wondered what happend to his other work.

Ill formed masses of flesh each possessing the standard
number of arms, legs and toes, but shaped in such a way
to appear as if Dawinism had finally been rendered mute

depended only on ones ability to ambulate oneself

approved consumables. 

pBefore falling asleep that night, she thought about the day and felt
optimistic. Although the meeting did not go was well as she had hoped the
bankers had listened, showed genuine interest and promised to get back to
them with a plan. But experience told her that optimism was often followed
by doubt. For the past few years (and maybe her whole life, she really
could not remember) her emotional state seemed to vacilate between these
two extremes. But instead of resulting in a zero sum, these contrasting
forces seemed to reinforce each other, always pushing her forward like the
swing of a pendelum drives the hand of a clock.

Why did anyone who aspired to any sort of intellectual status feel guilty
about this box. They would deny watching it as if they honestly believed
this. The whole country had moved into a sense of denial as if it were an
epidemic. But had it always been this way? Did people always feel a
conflict between their actual lives and their perceived lives. Was modern
life just filled with more guilty pleasures. 

Even the dog ignores the television. The dogs life seems changed little
since his domestication. In the modern world his freedom is more restricted
but his interaction with the world remains the same.  He sleeps. He eats.
He sleeps without regard for modern light. Still finding his rythm of the
sun. Television sets have not effect on the dog. He rides in cars, but
without intention or car. It is not a great machine of conveyance, but
simply a place to be like any other. He is equally oblivious to his own
mortality yet still shares our instinct for survival. 

We would attend lectures at a local university. The professors rarely
minded the five extra students in their class more than confrontation.
While Dad sometimes just listened, more often than not he would start
asking questions and move the sleepy students into debate. Once sitting in
the back of the room. The professor was engaged in a lecture about
Taylorism. The students sat some slumped in their chairs doodling in their
notebooks, some taking notes, some staring past the professor their mind
working through some unrelated problem. Without waiting for a pause in the
professors lecture, Dad asked "What are the benefits of efficiency?" The
professor stopped unused to interruption. He looked at Dad and seemed about
to ask his name, but at that point Dad rose from his seat, the professor,
responded, "Well they should be self evident."  "How efficient is this?" he
pointed around the room at the students "The seem hardly the most effective
way to deliver information." "Look here" he took a notebook from one of the
students "It appears your lecture has inspired a rather naughty picture. If
that was the intention..well" 

We entered a corporate feeding station. Where people wore name tags. He
hated name tags. We walked right into the kitchen. No one cared because
they did had no personal interest. They were just placed there and told to
do their job. The cook staff spoke spanish and Dad immediately began
talking to them. We ate soup and bread. It was late and Dad said they all
wanted to go home from a long day so he instructed us to help clean so
everyone could go home early.

And so we found ourselves at the zoo. He had never really talked about
zoos, but had used "zoo" or "animals in a cage" as a way of describing.  As
we methodically made our way through each exhibit, Dad would point the
different animals which he knew by species and type without reading the
public descriptions. He would describe the creatures native habitat
including floral, climate and geographic location.  He would tell us the
range of area commanded by each creature in its daily life and migration.
All in stark contrast to their present predicament. 

When we came to the primate exhibit, Michael made faces at the creatures
and Wendy and I laughed. As Dad was describing the life and habitat of
the gorilla to us he suddenly stopped. The gorilla was looking directly at
Dad and Dad was looking back at him and not speaking. The gorilla picked up
her baby and ran to one side of her pen and then the other, sat ate
something from the ground and looked back at Dad. She then left her
daughter and climbed up on a perch made of some sort of scaffolding
probably left over from construction. She looked back at Dad who just
stared. We did not know what Dad saw or why he stopped talking but we knew
enough not to ask. If Dad wanted to tell us something, he would tell us.

For the remainer of our visit Dad sent us on our way to explore while he
wandered silently around the zoo. We stayed for hours till the zoo closed
and were very late to leave watching the keepers close the gates and for
the night. He seemed particularly interested in the rituals of the closing
of the zoo.

That evening at home he began drawing a map of the zoo from memory on a
large sheet of paper that he had taken from. Each of the pens, stables and
houses were carefully drawn to scale. All of the paths and labeled. As I
watched him draw, I knew there was a reason behind his work.

During dinner we talked about the zoo and the animals. Wendy told a story
about a man who had dropped his camera into the crocodile pit. (look up zoo
stories) Dad just listened and smiled.

After dinner he brought us round the map to describe his plan. We were
going to free the gorilla and as many animals as we could reach. He gave no
reason for this adventure. Micheal and Wendy were immediately drawn to the
plan and did not seem to care for an explanation. I knew enough not to ask.

We would enter the zoo in the afternoon about one hour before closing. One
at a time we would enter the snack hut which was closed an hour before the
zoo closed and. The plan was to remain in sight of the snack hut and enter
in ones and twos when no one was looking. It was a weekday so the zoo would
not be that busy. Dad had noted that the back door to the hut remained
opened. 

Once inside we were to commander a large backhoe that was near a
construction area. Dad said these were easy to start and they often left
the keys in the ignition. The plan was to run a cable from the tractor to
the bars of the cage. The cable would be used to pull down the bars of the
cage. Once we had freed the gorillas we would move on to the other pens.
Dad had marked this all on his map. Indicating where we would be at any
point in time. He had made estimates for how long each would take.


No sooner does the screen pop into her hand than some nacent idea journey
forth, still wet from birth, with a no more instinct than that necessary
for blinking and breathing, comes forth screaming and shouting and dying. 

We stood watching a girls soccer game. We had been on our way to the store
and I am not sure why we stopped.  It was just one of those moments were we
all seemed to have the same thought at once. The girls on our side of the
field were from the local high school. We didn't say anything. Dad seemed
to be studing the game very carefully. The local team appeared to be
losing. 

Dad then turned to us and said, the problem is that they are not using
their hands. You see, each team is trying to move the ball into the other
team's goals, but if they just used their hands it would be so much easier.
Suddenly the game appeared as silly as a sack race with girls awkwardly
trying to 

Just as the ball came close to where we were standing, Dad ran onto the
field grabbed the ball with his hands and then started running toward the
opposing team's goal. Both referres were blowing their whistles and moving
toward him. The girls just stopped playing and stood staring at Dad as he
ran past them making his way to the goal.  As he flung the ball in the
goal, Michael and Wendy let out huge cheers and I joined in with them.  

Every little trival thought that enters one's head is immediately sent out
into the universe, ideas barely formed. The cost of transmission too easy.
The barrier too low. No need or time to sit with a thought and work it out.
No time to think at all. The cost of transmission so small that the merest
thought could be flung into the universe. Television as insidious as it
was, was at least created with some effort. Some work went into creating
the scripts. Some thought went into working with the actors, albeit for the
masses. But we had traded one medium curated for the masses with another
currated by the masses with no great improvement. No need for sustained
thought. No time for ideas to be born and die before reaching maturity. No
time for maturity at all. Sustained thinking was no longer necessary or
even possible. 

Every part of a mechanical device is designed to work in coordination. The
spindle drives the rod which turns the disk which moves the piston. Each
process of revolving, sliding, swinging, lifting, catching each produce
their own vibrations.  Each motion transfers its motion to the next. Each
motion produces an even rhythm. The rhythm is intentional. There is a
difference between a machine that goes clack, clack, clack Every time two
mechanical parts meet there is vibration. But man can't design a perfect
machine so he designs
