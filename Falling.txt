From his office window, James watched as a woman across the street yelled at a
man sitting on a bench. He couldn't hear her yell, but he could see her arms
waving and he could see the tension in her body. The man looked up at her, but
did not seem all that concerned. 

The drama across the street was nothing new. James has seen it play
x-jout since he moved into this office four years ago, and he imagined it
been going on since long before. The cast of characters tended to vary
throughout the year, though there were a few regulars.  Their numbers
increased in the summer months to more than a dozen and dwindled in
the winter. He has heard that there was a methadone clinic nearby as a
way of explaining their presence.

They were mostly white, but of assorted shapes, sizes, ages and genders. They
would shout, laugh, gesture, dance, cajole, negotiate, argue, yell and sometimes
even fight, but never to any great effect.  They wore jackets, pants, sundresses
and skirts, and held hand bags and cell phones just like everyone else, but they
were different because their lives were not punctuated by the usual changes of
venue associated with work day, evening and weekend.  Their lives just rolled
along continuously in this one location each day from morning to night. What
amazed James most was that no matter when he looked out the window they seemed
to be engaged in conversations often of apparenlty vital importance.  James
could barely hold a five minute conversation with anything new to say to his
wife after being away at work for the whole day.

As James looked out his window and watched, his thoughts drifted to
his son.  For the past year, he had looked out his window and thought
about his son. For the past year, he has also done so little work,
that he felt he should have been fired or, at the very least, moved to
a desk without a window.  He just assumed that his manager felt sorry
for him and that when she weighed the cost of his misery against cost
of his job she came out even. He wasn't planning to argue with her on
this point.

Someone had once told him that after a year, you either move on or you
don't.  James was not moving on. A year ago, James's son was hit by
car and killed as he was walking home from school. The driver was not
drunk or senile, just careless and probably texting, though this was
never proven. 

That evening as he brushed his teeth, he could hear the traffic outside his
house through the open windows. When he moved to his house ten years ago, the
street was mostly quiet. Now there was traffic every morning and every evening.
Where had all these cars come from?

James hated cars. He hated them because of what they had done to Tim.
He hated how they filled his streets. He hated their noise. He hated
the danger. He hated how they segregated his city into tiny blocks. He
hated how they seemed to spend most of their energy just carrying
themselves around his city.

The next morning, he waited to cross the street to catch his bus to work. When
it was finally clear to cross a car came out from a side street heading down the
opposite side of the street in his direction. Instead of walking back to the
sidewalk to wait again, he stopped where he was in the lane and waited for the
car to pass.  But the car was followed by another and now there was now a car
coming toward him on his side of the street. He didn't move. He just stood there
and waited. The car coming toward him stopped and with in a short time more cars
backed up behind it. There were still cars traveling on the opposite side of the
street, and so he just stood there.  

After about thirty seconds, a car began to honk. Then one of the cars raced
around him when it was clear on the opposite side of the street.  James just
stood there looking straight ahead. He started to smile to himself at how
fragile the whole system suddenly seemed. One man standing in one lane of one
road and cars starting to back up farther than he could see.  

He also thought about his neighbors watching him. He thought about the people
in the cars watching him. He wondered if anyone he knew could see him standing
there in the street. He wondered what they would think. He figured they would
just think he was crazy. Not a bad assumption he thought.

A few minutes later he heard a siren. He was certain they were coming
to remove him from the street and he felt some relief that there was
now a definite (someone else had come up with) resolution to his
situation. He almost smiled as he noticed the difficultly the police
car had getting through the traffic, but thought it best not to betray
any emotion for the moment.

The police car stopped near him and the officers both got out. One started to
direct traffic around him and the other came over to ask if he was okay. He
said he was and the officer asked if he would mind moving back to the side
walk. James agreed and walked off the street escorted by the officer.

The officer asked him why he was standing in the street and he said he
didn't know. He said he was tired and confused. His wife and daughter
where inside the house. He could see them watching him and afraid to
come out.  

The officer did not feel the need to site James for any violation, but walked
him back to his house where his wife Brenda finally came out to meet them. The
officer suggested to Brenda that she take James to the emergency room so that
he could be evaluated. She agreed and they went back inside.

Brenda was worried. James said that he was just trying to cross the
street, but got stuck halfway and was not sure what to do. He said he
hadn't very slept well for the past few nights. It was the kind of
explanation that only made sense if you wanted it to make sense. James
said he was fine and headed off to work again, but agreed to walk down
to the intersection to cross the street.

That night when he got home from work the house felt even quiter than
usual.  Brenda was in the kitchen making dinner. His daughter had gone
to a friend's house for the night. His relationship with his daughter
had become strained over the last year or was it years. He could not
remember how long. He could remember that there was a time when she
would run to hug him as soon as he came in the door.  He had heard
that this change was just typical adolescent behavior, but he could
not help thinking that it was somehow his fault.

He talked with his wife about his day, but not about the morning. She
had some news about her sister's divorce and whether or not she was
going to move back to the city to be near them. After dinner he said
he wanted to go for a bike ride. She let him go. She had been more
than accomodating over the past year as he tried to find his way back
to his normal life. Though he wondered how long this would last.

(It had been his habit to go out for a ride after dinner)

It was the beginning of summer and the days were long as he headed
down his driveway. This time instead of trying to cross traffic, he
set off in its flow. He had learned to ride a bike as kid, but had not
ridden much until recently. He followed the newly painted bike lanes
farther into the city. 

Behind him he began to hear shouts, and whoops and bells.  He looked
back to see a large group of bicylist coming down the middle of the
road. They quickly surrounded him. A few smiled inviting him to join
their (circus), though most ignored him.

Surrounded by bikes he felt safe on the road, and he moved more into
the street. As they approached a traffic light the group stopped,
though some continued to ride in small circles as they waited for the
light to change. They wanted to be seen. They wanted to be heard. They
wanted to be noticed. Ringing bells. They were young and dressed in
way that felt intimidating not in way that suggested tough but not
violent but tough in a way that suggested exclusion.

They were stopped in front of a line of cars and the car directly
behind them began to honk its horn even though the light was still
red. And while the car posseses only Ksingle word  seems to have only
a monlithic ability to vocallize, this particular honk did not
indicate comrodarly with the hoots and howls of the riders, but more
of a get out of my way.  The light was still red so this seemed to
only indicate that a problem of traffic flow was percieved not actual. 

The attention of the group focused on this car. Shouts, yells and
ringing in response to honks. Finally, the driver leaned out of his
window and yelled, get out of the road.  

As the light turned green, most of the group moved on but about five
bikes stayed where they were. James stayed with them sitting on his
bike in the lane in front of the car though this time he was not
alone. The car pushed forward into the bike behind him knocking rider
off. The ride quickly jumped up, picked up his bike and threw it at
the front window of the car. He and second rider were quickly at the
the drivers side of the car, reached in and opened the door.

The other bikers rode in small circles around the scene forming a
protective circle. James just sat on his bike looking forward.

The two men pulled the driver from his seat. A woman beside him
screamed. They were shouting at him and pushing him traping him as he
tried to run. Then one grabbed him and the other punched the driver.

At this point they heard a siren. One of the bikers said, "Come on
Jason, lets go." Another said, "Jay, lets get out of here." The man
holding the driver dropped him near the car and got on his bike. The
other man walked over to James and pushed him to the ground. He picked
up Jame's bike and rode off with the other four.

As James stood up a woman was yelling at him. This was not the woman from the
car. She was with the man lying in the street along with two other pedestrians
who where attending to him. Another person was trying to consol the woman from
the car. 

James notice that at the scene of an accident an audience forms and actors
emerge from the to take on roles to fill out the scene. The woman yelling at
him had taken on the role of defending the victim by James decided that it was
time to leave and turned to make his way through the crowd. The woman did not
follow him, afraid to leave the stage.

James was born.
