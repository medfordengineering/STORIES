From his office window, James watched as a woman across the street
yelled at a man sitting on a bench. He couldn't hear her yell, but he
could see her arms raised and her fists clenched and her mouth open and
her eyes looking down on him as if she might consume him at any moment.
The man looked up and watched her, but did not seem all that concerned. 

The drama across the street was nothing new. James had seen it play out
everyday since he moved into his office four years ago. The cast of
characters varied throughout the year, though there were a few regulars.
Their numbers increased in the summer months and dwindled in the winter.
He had heard that there was a methadone clinic nearby by way of an
explanation.

They were mostly white, but of assorted shapes, sizes, ages and genders.
They would shout, laugh, gesture, dance, cajole, negotiate, argue, yell
and sometimes even fight, but never to any great effect.  They wore
jackets, pants, sun dresses and skirts, and held hand bags and cell phones
just like everyone else, but they were not like everyone else.

Their lives were not punctuated by the usual changes of venue associated
with work day, evening and weekend.  Their lives unfolded continuously in
this one location each day from morning to night like actors on a
perpetual stage playing for no one but James or so it seemed to him, for
no one else ever seemed to notice them.  

What amazed James most was that they always seemed to be engaged in
conversations, often of apparently vital importance. James wondered what
could be so important. What dramatic conflict was mounting or being
resolved in lives that seemed to have no external consequence. By
contrast, James's generally found any conversation lasting more than
twenty minutes usually required work.

As James looked out his window and watched, his thoughts drifted to his
son. For the past year, he had looked out his window and thought about his
son. For the past year, he has also done so little work, that he felt he
should have been fired or, at the very least, moved to a desk without a
window. He could only assume that his manager felt sorry for him and that
when she weighed the emotional cost of firing him against monetary cost of
his lack of productivity, he came out slightly ahead. He wasn't planning
to argue with her on this point.

Someone had once told him that after a year, you either move on or you
don't.  James was not moving on. A year ago, James's son was hit by car and
killed as he was walking home from school. The driver was not drunk or
senile, just careless and young.

That evening at home as he brushed his teeth before going to bed, he
listened to the sound of traffic outside the open bathroom window. The
sound was not so steady that he couldn't make out the individual vehicles,
a truck then a bus, then a series of cars each with a distinct sound and
direction. In most cases, it was not just the sound of the car's engine or
any sort of mechanical noise that he heard, but the woosh the car made as
it pushed through the sea of air, creating waves that spread like the wake
from a boat. They entered his house through windows and walls and
expending their energy against everything in their path. 

And even late at night when the volume of traffic on his street was
reduced to only a whisper, there remained the constant and pervasive hum
that resulted from a synthesis of the waves from all the traffic for miles
around leaving no possibility for silence.

The next morning, James stood waiting to cross his street to catch the bus
to work. When he and his wife had moved to this house ten years ago, the
street was mostly quiet. Now there always seemed to be traffic. Where had
all these cars come from he wondered and where were they all going?

It seemed to take even longer than usual to find a break in the traffic.
First there was traffic on one side of the street and then on the other.
When the street was finally clear on both sides he started across, but just
then a car came out from a side street and moving in his direction.
Instead of walking back to the sidewalk, he just stopped where he was in
the street and waited for the car to pass in front of him.  But this car
was followed by another and now there was now a car coming toward him in
the lane where he was standing. He didn't move. He just stood there and
waited.  The car coming toward him stopped and within a short time more
cars backed up behind it. There were still cars traveling on the opposite
side of the street, and so he just stood there.  

After about twenty seconds, one of the cars began to honk, but James did
not move. He began to feel as though he couldn't move as though he
needed to be there, as though he were now a fixture in the pavement.
Even when there was break in the traffic on the other side of the
street, he just stood there. A few cars tried to dart around him. James
just stood there looking straight ahead. And as he stood there he
started to smile to himself. He smiled at how fragile the whole system
suddenly seemed. He smiled at how one man standing in one lane of a
street could, in only a few minutes, cause cars to back up farther then
he could see.

He also thought about his neighbors watching him. He thought about the
people in the cars watching him. He wondered if anyone he knew could see
him standing there in the street. He wondered what they would think. He
figured they would just think he was crazy. Not a bad assumption he
thought.

A few minutes later he heard a siren. He was certain they were coming to
remove him from the street. He felt some relief that there was now a
definite resolution to his situation, one from which he seemed unable to
extricate himself. He almost smiled as he noticed the difficultly the
police car had getting through the traffic, but thought it best not to
betray any emotion.

The police car stopped near him and the officers both got out. One started
to direct traffic around him and the other came over to ask if he was okay.
He said he was and the officer asked if he would mind moving back to the
side walk. James agreed and walked off the street escorted by the officer.

The officer asked him why he was standing in the street and he said he
didn't know. He said he was tired and confused. Looking toward his house,
he could see his wife and daughter inside. He could see them watching him,
embarrassed to come out.  

The officer did not feel the need to site James for any violation, but
walked him back to his house where his wife Sarah had come out to meet
them on the steps. The officer suggested to Sarah that she take James to
the emergency room so that he could be evaluated. She agreed and they went
back inside.

Sarah was worried. James said that he was just trying to cross the street,
and got stuck halfway, not sure what to do. He said he hadn't very slept
well for the past few nights. It was the kind of explanation that only made
sense if you wanted it to make sense. Sarah looked at him without saying
anything. James said he was fine and headed off to work again, but agreed
to walk down to the intersection and cross at the crosswalk.

That evening when he got home from work he found Sarah in the kitchen
making dinner. His daughter had gone to a friend's house for the night. He
felt relieved by her absence and then guilty. His relationship with his
daughter had become strained over the last year or was it years.  He could
not remember.  He could remember that there was a time when she would run
to hug him as soon as he came in the door. He had heard that the change in
their relationship was just typical adolescent behavior, but he could not
help thinking that it was somehow his fault.

He asked his wife about their plans for the weekend. Not that he cared, he
simply wanted to fill the silence. She said she had talked with her sister,
who was getting divorced and that she might come visit. She had plans to
move back to the city to be near them. This topic carried the conversation
through dinner. After dinner he said he wanted to go for a bike ride. She
let him go. She had been more than accommodating over the past year as he
tried to find his way back to a normal life.  Though he wondered how long
this would last.

It was early summer and the days were long. He walked his bike to the end
of the driveway and instead of trying to cross the traffic, he set off in
its flow. He had only recently taken up riding a bike again. The last time
he owned a bike was in college. He still felt nervous riding in the street,
he was either too close to the cars in the street or too close to the cars
parked on the side of the road and never exactly sure where he belonged. 

As he headed into the city the buildings grew larger and closer together.
There were more vehicles and more lanes of traffic. There were lanes for
turning left and right and going straight making it all the more
complicated. He decided it was time to turn back, but just as he was about
to turn, he heard from behind him people shouting, whooping and ringing
bells. He could tell they were on bikes because the noise was quickly
closing in on him.  

Suddenly they were all around him. They were young and tough and harsh and
loud. They wore clothes that were dark and made from denim and leather and
metal. A few of them smiled at him as if inviting him to join their fun,
but most just ignored him. They were focused the on the world around them,
making sure the world knew they existed.

As they carried him along in their wake, James no longer felt nervous about
his place in the street.

The group came to a traffic light and stopped. James stopped with them.
Some stood over their bikes, but others continued to ride around in circles
as if they were too nervous to stop. As they waited for the light to
change, the car directly behind them honked its horn and the group answered
with shouts and bells and jeers. The car honked again and again the group
responded with even more noise. The light was still red. The group began to
focus its attention on the car answering each honk with increased
attention. Finally, the driver leaned out of his window and yelled, "Get
the hell out of the road."

As the light turned green, most of the group moved on but five of the bikes
that had been circling continued to circle in front of the car. James
stayed with them standing over his bike in the lane and in front of the car
and looked ahead. This time he was not alone. The car gunned its engine and
honked and then it pushed forward into one of bikes knocking the rider off.
The rider quickly jumped up, picked up his bike and threw it at the front
window of the car cracking the windshield. He and a second rider were
quickly at the drivers side of the car. One of them reached in and opened
the door and grabbed the driver.

The other bikers continued to ride in circles around the entire scene which
now included the car, their two friends, James and the driver. James just
stood over his bike but was now looking back at what was happening.

The two men pulled the driver from his seat. A woman who had been sitting
beside him screamed. Once out of the car, they were shouting at driver and
pushing him back and forth between them. They stopped him as he tried to
run. Then one grabbed him from behind while the and the other punched him
in the chest and in the face. James watched.

Just then they began to hear the wail of a siren in the distance. One of
the bikers said, "Come on Jason, lets go." Another said, "Jay, lets get out
of here." The man holding the driver dropped him on the pavement near the
car and got on his bike. The other man whose bike had been damaged by the
car walked over to James looked at him for a moment and then pushed him
hard to the ground, picked up James's bike and rode off with the other
four.

When James stood up a woman was yelling at him. The driver of the car
was lying on the ground and not moving. The woman from the car was next
to the man on the ground and crying. A young man was consoling the woman
from the car, another man and woman were attending to the driver, an
older man was trying to keep back the crowd that had formed. People who
only moments ago had been pedestrians were now playing important roles
in the dramatic scene that had unfolded around him, as if actors, hidden
among pedestrians  James thought walked among pedestrians always ready
for their part in any play.

James turned to leave. The woman continued to shout at him but remained
where she stood, seemingly willing to leave her mark on the stage. The
crowd hesitantly made way for his exit, uncertain if this was part of the
script.

James decided to walk home. As he made his way down the sidewalk, the scene
of the accident slowly faded behind him and into the general wash of the
city. He was in no hurry to get home, but was glad to have a destination.
His hand throbbed from where he had landed on it when he fell. The blood
from a scrape was already starting to dry. He noticed that his shirt was
torn and there was bike grease on his pants. But cloaked in the city and in
the night he felt relatively inconspicuous.

As he walked, his mind sorted through the jumble of events that made up his
day. He tried to arrange these events into a logical sequence of cause and
effect. Why was he standing in the street? Why did he tell his wife he was
just tired?  Why did the two men fight? Why did he get punched? None of his
questions seemed to have an answer.

Frustrated in his thoughts, his attention was drawn to the scenes that
played out around him in the late hours of night. Two boys and a girl
walked in his direction, young and drunk, a lazy knot of arms that
swayed and laughed as they made their way past. A group of people well
dressed and anxious, lined up against a long dark wall and waited for
their turn to enter a night club. A man with silver hair in a
well-pressed suit and tie left a liquor store holding a bottle in a
paper bag. The name of the store spelled out in bright bulbs and neon
trim.  Across the street, a group of boys hopped, danced and spun down
the sidewalk simultaneously frenetic and aimless. A car with girls
inside drove by. The boys shouted for their attention. Between them a
bottle was tossed and broke in the street, but from which party, James
could not tell. 

James felt he shared little more with these people than species.

As James neared his home, hungry and in no rush, he decided to stop at a
sandwich shop and get a slice of pizza. Inside a young couple sat at a
booth next to the window. The boy ate a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs
in a watery tomato sauce and the girl watched a television set behind
his head. In another booth an older man had fallen asleep, but bothering
no one, he was left alone. 

Two men in aprons worked behind the counter. Both short in stature with
dark hair and forearms thick from generations of use. One called to the
other in a language the James did not understand. James assumed they
were brothers and that they were from Italy or Greece. The girl pointed
to something on the television. The boy turned to look, nodded and then
went back to his bowl of spaghetti. James placed his order. The man
handed him his change. James wanted to say something more. He wanted to
ask him a question about where he was from or maybe how long he had
worked there.  He had been to the shop many times before and had seen
other customers chat informally with the men behind the counter. But
James could think of nothing to say. He took his change and sat down to
eat his slice of pizza.

As he approached his house he noticed a police car in the driveway. He
started to run toward the house and then stopped. The police car was
quiet and empty indicating no sense of emergency. He also did not relish
another encounter with the police. The lights of his first floor were
on. His mind raced through what could have brought them to his house.
There had been burglaries in the neighborhood. Maybe his house had been
robbed. Then the image of the man lying in the street came back into his
consciousness. Was it possible that the man was dead? This was something
he had not considered. Could the police be looking for him? Could they
have found him? It all did not seem possible. And yet there the police
car sat in his driveway in the middle of the night.

He was now close enough to his house to see inside. Under the bright
artificial light of his living room, his wife was standing talking to
two police officers. He watched them trying to get a better sense of the
nature of their conversation from how they stood and how they moved. He
imagined what they might be saying and even though he imagined himself
the subject of the conversation he still felt as if he were simply
observing a scene in which he had no part.

Inside his house, the same officer who had been there in the morning was
saying to his wife that in order to even file a missing person report, her
husband would to have been missing for at least 24 hours. He also reminded
her that she should have taken him to the emergency room as he suggested.
He promised he would keep a look out and would file an official report as
soon as he could.

James saw the police officers turn to leave. He turned and ran both
quickly and quietly down the driveway. He would return when the police
were gone and his wife was asleep.

A half hour later, he quietly entered and made his way to his bedroom.
Without waking his wife, he slipped into his bed and waited sleep to
erase the day. 

At exactly 7:30, their alarm clock began its steady beat but for a few
minutes was unable to rouse either James or Sarah. Finally Sarah, usually a
light sleeper, pulled herself out of slumber.  Seeing James lying next to
her, she began to rock him awake saying "James, it is 7:30" and then, as he
sat up and looked at her trying to focus, she asked him, "What happened to
you last night?  When did you get home?" James explained about the bike
accident and that he had walked home. As he told his story, she examined
his wounded hand. Holding it, he watched as she gently traced the outline
of his scraped skin. 

She then looked up at him and asked "Are you alright?" "Yes, I am fine."
he lied. "Why didn't you call me? Don't you think I worry?" she asked.
He responded that by the time he thought to call she would have been
asleep, an excuse which neither he nor she believed. `	

"I called the police." she said. "Oh" he said. "I didn't know what else
to do." she said shaking her head. "Why are you doing this?" she asked
in a different tone, one that made him think she had finally had enough.
He wondered why it had taken her so long.  "Doing what?" he said.
"Don't you know that I feel everything you feel, that I also think about
him every day and that every time I think about him my heart aches with
a pain so deep that I don't know how I will survive it." She paused
looking at him. "Are you going to go on like this forever?" He said he
didn't want to but he was not even sure if that was true.  "Because I
don't think I can take it anymore." she said still looking directly at
him.

She looked at his hand again, she had not stopped holding it. "Does it
hurt?" "A little" he said, relieved to be asked a question that he could
finally answer honestly.

On his way to work he sat on the bus thinking that maybe today would be
different. Though he could think of no evidence to support this. He
looked at the scab on his hand. Yesterday was real, he thought.

He made it to work on time. That was one thing you could say for him he
thought as he sat down at his desk at 9am. He was never late for work.
He looked at the stack of folders that were waiting for him. Each folder
contained an insurance claim that he needed to review. Each one a
complaint about some minor tragedy and a demand for monetary
compensation. Tragedies that were perpetrated by acts of God or
criminals and directed at the sorts of objects that could be repaired,
rebuilt or replaced, but never made the same. That was how the world
worked, he thought. Nothing ever returned to its original state.  

His job was to find the flaw in the applicant's story, evidence that
their loss was not as tragic as claimed and he had been good at his job.

Toward the middle of the afternoon, he got a call from a secretary
requesting that he meet with Denise, the division supervisor at the end
of the day.  She was his boss's boss. He had only met with her a few
times before. Once when he was first hired.

As he entered her office, she was just finishing a phone call. She
pointed to a seat in front of her desk. After putting down the phone,
she asked him how he was doing. She said she was sorry for his loss and
that it must be terrible.  She looked at him with that same sort of
smile that he had seen on so many other faces as if she were trying to
understand his sadness. It seemed to him an odd human instinct that was
both impossible and pointless.

She then looked down at some papers and began to review his job
performance over the past year. It then dawned on him what was
happening. She reviewed the numbers of claims he had processed over
various periods of time. Apparently for one six-week period, he had done
absolutely nothing. She talked about understanding and responsibility.
As she spoke, he heard himself respond acknowledging everything she said
and he felt himself slowly rising as if he were no longer in his chair
but looking down on her from a few feet above his chair. She did not
seem to notice. All he wanted was for the conversation to be over. He
wanted her to stop. If he had had a white flag he would have waved it.
Finally he heard her say, "I'm sorry." which seemed to indicate that she
was finished. He said "Thank you" and left. 

As he made his way back to his desk he felt the weight of no one looking at
him. 

At his his desk, he stared at the stack of unprocessed claims. Why had
they given him so many? Were they offering him one last chance to prove
that he still had what it took to be a productive member of the company?
If so, then why not tell him? He could have risen to the occasion. He
might have, he thought.  

He picked up a photo of his family that he kept in the top drawer and
put it in his shirt pocket. He looked around, not sure what else to
take. There was nothing else that was his. He did not want to be accused
of stealing. 

He looked around the room. He thought maybe he should say goodbye to
someone. Over the past year, he had stopped talking with the few people
he knew and it seemed like an awkward time to start.

A few minutes later a security guard who had been standing across the
room came over to him and asked him for his identity badge.  The guard
called him "sir." He knew the guard's name. "Donald" was printed above
the pocket on his uniform, but in all the years at the company James had
never spoken to him. Donald escorted him out of the building and
before closing the door behind him said, "Have an nice evening, sir." 

James stood outside the building squinting into the low sun that peaked
under dark clouds moving in from the West. Across the street a familiar
woman was laughing. James turned to watch her.  She was laughing in a
way that carried her body forward and then back as she tried to maintain
balance rocking from one foot to the other. "What could she be laughing
at?" James thought. Maybe she was laughing at him.  Maybe she knew that
he had lost his job. Maybe she was, in fact, a siren, who had for the
past year patiently drawn his attention from his work until finally he
stood outside his office, the door closed and locked behind him.

With nowhere else to go, James crossed the street. The woman stopped
laughing. It seemed that her joke had run its course. Her objective
realized she would turn her attention to another unsuspecting employee
who had the misfortune to sit at a desk overlooking the plaza. 

As he sat and watched, most her friends (or acquaintances he was never
sure how to think of them) were scattered around the plaza in groups of
twos and threes. The remainder flitted about between these small groups
pausing for conference as if to mimic a larger and more complex social
structure.

He pulled the picture from his pocket. His wife and daughter looked at
him.  They were smiling, but then didn't everyone smile in pictures?
What were they thinking? What was there to think? He pulled his wallet
from his pocket.  Whatever value it contained no longer belonged to him.
He placed the photo in the wallet.  He had heard that a wallet found in
a mailbox would be returned to its owner. He walked to the corner of the
plaza and tossed the wallet in a mailbox.

He returned his attention to the people in the plaza. He wondered where
they went at night. Didn't everyone go somewhere at night? He wondered
if when darkness fell complete, they just slowly came to a halt, like
windup creatures whose springs had finally exhausted enough energy that
they could no longer overcome the friction of their gears, and stood
resting motionless until their caretaker came round before dawn to wind
them back up again. 

It began to rain, a light but steady rain. Unprepared their world
quickly dissolved as they left their posts and gathered together in the
middle of the plaza. After a brief conference the majority headed off
together downtown. James followed.

They made a cumbersome group moving down the sidewalk. Sometimes three
and four abreast, sometimes spilling into the street. Every couple of
blocks the group would stop to adjust itself, like an old man stopping
to hike up his sagging trousers.

After about dozen blocks, they stopped and joined a line. The line lead
to the entrance of a large rectangular building efficiently constructed
from concrete and steel. It sat among a mix of buildings, mostly far
older and built of brick and stone and at a time when the hand of a
craftsman still held value. James wondered what tragedy had befallen the
building that previously occupied this space.

The rain remained light, but the crowd was anxious to enter the building
before it got worse. James asked the woman in front of him if she knew
when the building opened. The woman turned to face James. Close up she
looked older than she had seemed from afar. Her face tan from a life
spent outside. Her eyes rested in their sockets as if waiting for
something to arouse them from their slumber. James tried to imagine her
as a new born baby. Everyone was a new born baby once, he thought.

She said it opened at 7pm and added, "but ya'd think the bastards would
open up a little early with the rain." James agreed. 

At exactly 7pm the doors opened and people began to file in. By then the
line behind James extended to the end of the block. Inside, the lobby
was crowded, bright and humid. It smelled of warm bodies and wet
clothes. As a first time guest, James was required to meet with an
in-take councilor and stood in line with other first time guests.

He felt in his pocket. He had no wallet and no ID. "Would he need one to
stay here? All these people can't have identification" he thought? He
would, at least, need a name. "Jacob" was the first name that came to
him and it seemed suitable. "Jacob Jackson or JJ for short. New names
were easy." he thought. He rehearsed the name in his head as he stood
in line.

Inside a private room, James sat across from the councilor. The
councilor asked him for some identification. James started with the
truth, saying he did not have any, but then added that he lost his
wallet. The councilor paused and looked at him suspiciously over his
glasses, "Well it is not a requirement for a bed in the shelter but it
is helpful." He said but did not explain why. "First and last name?"
"Jacob, Jacob Jackson, my friends call me JJ." James responded. It
sounded awkward this time and James thought maybe he had practiced too
much. The councilor followed up with "Date of birth?" "Last permanent
address?" "Are you taking any medication?" "Are you presently employed?"
"Are you married?" "Are you receiving any treatment for drug addiction?"
James answered the questions with a mix of truth and fiction. "Who
should we contact in case of a medical emergency?" James paused. "No
one." The councilor looked up from the form. "No brothers, no sisters,
an aunt, a cousin?" "No." said James.

The councilor gave James two small slips of paper with numbers on them.
One was for his bed assignment and the other for fresh clothing. James
reentered the lobby which had mostly emptied out. A few people, clearly
intoxicated where being directed out of the shelter. A staff member
directed him toward the door to the men's unit. 

On the door were posted instructions that read, "Men Only" and "No one
under 18 allowed." Inside were more instructions. The first in large red
letters read, "All residents must take a shower before entering the
dormitory"

The showers were along one wall of an open stall and were overseen by
shelter staff. Five men stood naked lathering their bodies with soap.
James could not remember ever seeing a grown man naked before. They
looked comical. Devoid of clothing their bodies seemed fragile and
unbalanced and generations removed from the demands of the feral plain.
Watching them James undressed slowly, hesitant to expose his own fragile
body to judgement.

After drying off and wearing only a towel, James was directed to an
adjacent coat room where he could get fresh clothes.  Standing in line
he heard a voice behind him, "First time here?" James turned to see a
slightly built older man about half a foot shorter than himself. "Yes"
said James uncertain whether he wanted to foster this man's association.
"You should easily get your size." he said "Me, everything they have is
too big.  White shirts are the easiest to fit, but they get dirty right
away and then your stuck.  Most people ask for jeans so they go fast. I
suggest asking for something different." "Thanks for the advice" said
James.  "Anytime." he said and the offering his hand added, "My name's
Isaac." "I'm Jacob" said James or "JJ" he added awkwardly.

Self consciously James followed Isaac's advice asking the staff member
behind the counter for corduroy pants and a checked shirt.  He had not
worn corduroy pants since he was a kid and had never owned a checked
shirt. He tried them on in another open room and again under the
supervision of shelter staff. The shirt and pants both seemed to fit,
but it was generally his wife who noticed if his sleeves were too long
or his collar too big. 

Leaving the coat room, he found the door to the dormitory. Before
entering, he scanned the 23 items listed under "Resident Rules and
Responsibilities" which covered everything from number 5. "No public
display of affection will be tolerated" to number 9."Residents are
limited to two large or three small bags of belongings." It ended with
"Violation of any rule may result in disciplinary action the dismissal
from the shelter."

The dormitory was one open room that seemed to take up most of one floor
of the building and was almost entirely filled with cots neatly
organized in large rectangle of rows and columns.

Just inside the door, he heard Isaac who had just come in behind him.
"Hey JJ, follow me. I'll show you were to get a bed sheet and blanket."
Once both James and Isaac had their bedding, Isaac asked to see James's
bed assignment. "36" he said, "that's over by the coke machine a few
rows in." he pointed. "I'll show you." "That's okay" said James. "I am
sure I can find it myself."

James quickly decoded the pattern of numbers which ran down one column
across and the up the next column. Finding his assigned cot, he sat down
and took a moment to take in his surroundings. Many, like him, were just
arriving and getting themselves settled in, though the man next to him
was already asleep fully clothed on his bare cot.

James spied the men from the plaza. They were assembled in one corner of
the room. Apparently they had already found a topic of contention. He
thought of the item under rules and regulations which specifically
prohibited, fighting, arguing and petty bickering. He wondered how often
these sorts of rules were enforced. Even in here the people from the
plaza stood out.

A few minutes later Isaac was sitting next to him on his cot. He tried
to recall if he had read any rules that prohibited this. Isaac started
in on a story about how someone had stolen his radio last week that
James had a hard time following. As Isaac spoke, James became aware of
Isaac's hands. The skin was dry and rough from a life unprotected from
the elements. There were large rough bumps on his hands, cuts and
abrasions that had been left to heal untended. James's own hands, by
contrast, were smooth. The few scares no more than lines of slight
discoloration. As Isaac finished James acknowledged the injustice that
Isaac had been subjected to.

Isaac offered to give James a tour of the dormitory with two hours left
until lights out, James felt like he needed a way to pass the time. 
paperback from a large shelf under a sign painted Library and found his
assigned cot. It was now 7pm. He had three hours till lights out. As
soon as the lights were turned out, James easily fell fast asleep.

At 6am Why do they get them in early to bed and early to rise as if by modeling
behavior they will gain the attributes of healthy, wealthy and wise. But

James has 30 days in the shelter. One his first day out.

HE BUILDS UP HABITS AND STUFF. HE WRITES IN A NOTEBOOK.

As James sat in his usual chair looking out over the sidewalk he noticed
a man and a woman walking down the sidewalk. The man was pushing a bike.
He was the man from the accident. He was the one who had pulled the
driver from the car and the one who had taken his bike. With no specific
plan, James quickly gathered his materials, placed them in his backpack
and left the library to follow the couple.

He had no trouble keeping up with them as they seemed to be in no rush
to reach their destination. They finally stopped at a small house that
sat comfortably among other equally small houses each in need of some
minor repair from a pealing paint to broken. Many with the hallmark of
student residents, bikes.

James stopped and watch them enter the house bringing the bike inside.
He felt self conscious standing on the street watching the house. 

James knocked on the door. After less than a minute a woman answered.
She opened the door just wide enough for her body to fill the gap. He
recognized her from the accident as well. She had been with the group
circling on bikes while the two men punched the driver. She did not seem
to recognize him. "Can I help you?" she asked in tone that indicated she
had no interest in helping him. "I was at the accident." he said. "What
accident?" "The one where your friend beat up the driver" She said
nothing and just looked at him her expression unchanged. "The driver who
hit your friends bike." "I was in front of the car as well.  Your friend
took my bike."

Her eyes narrowed slightly as she looked at him more carefully and then
said "Hold on" and closed the door. He could here people talking behind
the door. She opened the door again. She asked him "What do you want?"
He said, he wanted to come in. She said, "Sorry, I think you must have
the wrong house." and closed the door. 

James stood there, for a moment wondering if he could have been
mistaken. He knocked on the door again. There was a pause and then the
same woman answered the door and said, "You need to go away." James did
not move. The door opened wider and the man now stood beside her. He
said, "If you don't go away we will have you arrested for trespassing."
James said, "I want to come in." The man exasperated said, "What are you
doing here?  You think you saw some people beat up some guy a few weeks
ago and you think someone here looks like one of those people, but you
are mistaken so you need to go away." 

"I don't have anywhere else to go" said James. "What do you mean?" asked
the man. "I live in a shelter." "You live in a shelter." the man
repeated as if he was not sure he believed a word of what James was
saying. There was a pause and then James said, "I saw what happened."
"And what is that supposed to mean?" the man asked.

The door then shut again. James stood there for what seemed like five
minutes. The woman opened the door again and stood there. After a few
seconds she said, "Well, what are you waiting for?" As James entered the
man smiled and said, "One of us is definitely going to regret this and I
think it's going to be you." The woman said, "Don't mind Jay, he can be
a little dramatic." "Well, it's not like we need another mouth to feed."
"Don't worry, he doesn't look like he eats too much" said another man
standing in the entry to the kitchen, whom James recognized as the
person who had held the driver while Jay hit him.

"We are just making dinner. I assume you are in no rush?" the woman
said. "No" said James. "Well have a seat, it will be ready in about 20
minutes." The three went back to preparing dinner while James sat on the
couch quietly looking through a few books that were on the coffee table.

When diner was ready, they called James to the table which was set for
five. After everyone was served, one of the men said, "So tell us, why
they hell you are here." James told them his story from losing his son
to losing his job. He left nothing out with the exception of not
mentioning his daughter. They asked him lots of questions and he
answered them honestly. About fifteen minutes into the meal, a woman
entered the house.

After they seemed to have finished asking question. The man said,
"So you want to stay with us?" "Yes." said James. "And you know nothing
about us, except that you claim that you saw one of us beat up a
driver?" James nodded. The man looked at his friends and then turned
back to James. "Okay get out." said the man. James looked confused. "Go
out on the porch and wait, we need to talk about this."

James went out on the porch. Inside Jay spoke first. "This guy is a
lunatic" "Well, he'll be in good company" said Nick. "I don't understand
why are we even considering this?" said Jay. "Because he has threatened
to go to the police." said Erica. "We don't need that." said Nick.
Everyone was quiet for a moment.

"What, is he just going to sit around the house all day and eat our
food?" Jay looked at the group and then answering his question, said,
"If he stays, he rides. And he gets a job." "I'm okay with that." said
Dice. "And he's not sleeping on the couch." added Jay. "He can sleep on
the back porch. We'll find some cushions." said Nick.

Nick smiled at Jay and said "You always said you wanted to build an
army." Jay just shook his head.

Jay opened the door and invited James back in. "In case you don't
already know, I'm Jay." each of the others introduced themselves. Jay
explained that he could sleep on porch. He also said that he would need
to get a job. They would find him a bike actually we still have your
piece of crap.

That night Jay slept on the cold porch. It felt good to be alone.

As James and Jay finished drying the last of the dishes from dinner,
Nick started taking the bikes down from their rack on the wall. Leaving
the kitchen, Dice offered a baseball cap and handkerchief saying, "You
ready to go?" "Go where?" James asked. "Where we going Nick?" "Where
ever the wind takes us." said Nick. Dice pointed to the back porch, "Get
you bike in here so we can check it out." James went to get his bike and
brought it into the living room for Dice to check out. While James
waited he noticed that everyone had tied handkerchiefs around their
necks and were wearing either knit or baseball caps. The wore dark
tee-shirts or jackets and dark pants. 

Each were strapping hammers to their bikes.

As people began bringing their bikes outside, Dice said to James, "Just
stay close and do exactly as we do." Dice checked that James had tied
his handkerchief so that it could fit snugly on his face when he brought
it up. As the stood on the walk in front of you their house, Jay turned
to James, smiled and said, "You think you can keep up with us on that
piece of shit?" referring to James's bike "I guess so" said James
nervous about what was going to happen tonight.	

No lights no reflective clothing.

The five of them took off down the block moving at an easy pace for
James. They headed toward the city with each of the four taking the lead
at various points. The rode in single file and two abreast where
possible. At first they generally seemed to be moving toward the city,
over time, James noticed that they seemed to be meandering, going left
and then. James enjoyed not having to think about where he was going. No
one spoke much. They stopped at lights. It felt like a nice evening
ride. It was getting later and later. There was some chatter when they
stopped to wait for a light. They stayed off busier roads.   

Nearing a crosswalk, Erica who was in lead signaled for the group to
stop as a woman stepped into the crosswalk. Behind James a sport truck
blasted its horn, gunned its engine an drove past intentionally and
dangerously close to Dice who was on the outside of the group. The woman
in the crosswalk, used to exercising caution, stopped well out of harms
way. Before the truck had even past, the group was back on their bikes
and moving.  Dice looked over at James smiled and said, "Its hammer
time." a reference to a popular hip hop song, that James did not
understand. She then pulled up her handkerchief and motioned to James to
do the same. 

The truck speed away with the bicycles in pursuit. Sensing danger, the
truck accelerated. It swerved into oncoming traffic to pass a slow
moving car. The bicycles kept pace, easily slipping through the traffic.
The bicycles were moving fast, impossibly fast it seemed to James who
could not keep up. Approaching a red traffic light, the truck turned
right skidding onto a side street and scraping against a parked car on
the opposite side of the street.

On the small and empty street, Jay stood off his saddle and accelerated
up to the driver's side of the truck. He raised his hammer and smashed
the driver side window. The driver lost control of the truck and for a
second it swerved left. This allowed Dice to move up to the passenger
side of the truck and Nick to move in just behind it. Dice, using her
left arm, swung her ice axe into the front right tire letting it get
wedged under the wheel well. The tire burst.  At the same time, Nick
threw his heavy spear into the truck's rear window.

This combination caused the truck to swerve further to the right hitting
a parked car. It fell forward on its crippled front wheel, and then
flipped completely on its side sliding to a stop in the middle of the
street.

The riders quickly surrounded the vehicle as it lay in the street. Jay
jumped on the side of the truck which was now its top. They raised their
retrieved axes, hammers and spears gave a feral cry of victory. The
driver crawled mostly unharmed through where the front windshield had
fallen out. Slightly dazed, the driver slowly regained his senses.
Confronted by the cyclist wild jeers and cries, he ran from the scene.

They all four then gathered around the front of the truck. James, who
had finally caught up, now joined them barely able to catch his breath.
The truck lay motionless its engine still running and coughing. Jay
opened the hood of the truck to expose the engine. He reached in,
grabbed a fuel line and pulled one end out. Fuel gurgled from the line
wetting Jays hands and spilling on the engine and road and then stopped.
The engine sputtered, gave one last cough and died. 

Jay walked over to James and placed his fuel soaked thumb on James lips.
He pressed his thumb against his lips and then into James's mouth so
that James could taste the acrid and oily fuel. "Distilled the bodies of
the most powerful mammals to walk the Earth." he said. Jay rubbed his
thumb in James's mouth like a mother soothing a teething babies gums.
Jay removed his thumb smiled at James and said, "Welcome." He then
tasted the fuel from his own fingers. Dice, Nick and Erica all reached
in the engine, wetting their own hands then licked the fuel from their
fingers.

In the distance they heard the sound of sirens winding up as firetrucks
began to make their way to the scene of the accident. They each quietly
mounted their bikes and rode home with Jay and Dice taking turns at the
lead.

"Did James ever tell you that he had a daughter?" Erica asked Dice one
afternoon when they were alone. "What?" said Dice. "Yesterday, he
mentioned to me that he had a teenage daughter." "When he first arrived,
Nick asked him if he had any other kids and he distinctly said No."
"Does it really matter that much?" asked Erica. "He lied to us and he is
an asshole." said Dice, whose father had left her family when she was
young adding "I am fine with him leaving his wife. She is an adult, but
not his daughter. We all need to talk. This matters to me, a lot." 

They agreed to meet on Wednesday evening when James would be at work and
Jay could get off early. Dice told what she learned from Erica and said,
"He intentionally lied to us."

That night they had left a chase unable to stop the car. Heading
downhill on a main street they took the middle lane. Dice looked at
James and swung her pick into his thigh. James twisted fell to the
street and on coming lane. James stood watching a car approach. He stood
and did not move. The oncoming car applied its brakes but too late.


Jude earned the money. By day he worked as a programmer and made enough to
support them all. He did not mind doing this. He enjoyed is work for the
most part and could not believe how much money they gave him. Jenna
volunteered in a soup kitchen. Dala worked as a social worker with
students. 

James was born in a small town in New Hampshire that had slowly made its
way from rural to suburban. He lived with his mother in a house that
belonged to the latter type and of no particular distinction. It resided
within a cluster of houses equally lacking in any sort of character, houses
that weren't designed so much as built. They served their purpose as basic
shelter including places for sleeping, eating and watching television.

James never knew his father although he did not leave the family until
James was two. If he existed at all it was in a sort of hazy, dream-like
memory that could not be distinguished from a photograph.

he streets were quiet. He walked in the hours between good and bad, when
the bad had given up and gone to bed and the good were still waiting for
the dawn to start their day.

The library had been built in the 1920s and was one of the majestic
buildings of the city. The large cool open space of the great room retained
its elegance as the city went through transformations from rich to poor and
back again. James just wandered the shelves looking for a book to read.
Choosing a book was always hard. He finally found something to read and
settled into a chair on the second floor of the building near a window. 

With no job and no money, he had not choice about his place in society.
With each niche there were requirements such as age, race and income.
Certain ones were only achieved by income. Some you just fell into by age
or social status. He could no more be a punk or valley girl. Though all of
these required some income, if only for the basic attire that the social
class expected. The status of homeless or transient required no capital of
any kind. In fact, it was the requirement. In that way it was a sort of
exclusive club. You could visit or pretend, but you could not truly belong
if you had capital assets.
