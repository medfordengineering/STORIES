From his office window, James watched as a woman across the street yelled
at a man sitting on a bench. He couldn't hear her yell, but he could see
her waving her arms and he could see the tension in her body.  The man
looked up at her, but did not seem all that concerned. 

The drama across the street was nothing new. James had seen it play out
everyday since he moved into his office four years ago. The cast of
characters varied throughout the year, though there were a few regulars.
Their numbers increased in the summer months and dwindled in the winter. He
had heard that there was a methadone clinic nearby by way of an explanation
for their presence.

They were mostly white, but of assorted shapes, sizes, ages and genders.
They would shout, laugh, gesture, dance, cajole, negotiate, argue, yell and
sometimes even fight, but never to any great effect.  They wore jackets,
pants, sundresses and skirts, and held hand bags and cell phones just like
everyone else, but they were obviously different, though it was hard to put
your finger on exactly why. 

One difference was that their lives were not punctuated by the usual
changes of venue associated with work day, evening and weekend. Their lives
just rolled along continuously in this one location each day from morning
to night like actors on a perpetual stage. What amazed James most was that
no matter when he looked out the window they seemed to be engaged in
conversations and often ones of apparently vital importance. What could
they possibly be talking about thought James. James could barely think of
anything interesting to talk about with his wife after being away at work
for the whole day.

As James looked out his window and watched, his thoughts drifted to his
son. For the past year, he had looked out his window and thought about his
son. For the past year, he has also done so little work, that he felt he
should have been fired or, at the very least, moved to a desk without a
window. He just assumed that his manager felt sorry for him and that when
she weighed the emotional cost of firing him against monitary cost of his
job he came out slightly ahead. He wasn't planning to argue with her on
this point.

Someone had once told him that after a year, you either move on or you
don't.  James was not moving on. A year ago, James's son was hit by
car and killed as he was walking home from school. The driver was not
drunk or senile, just careless and probably texting, though this was
never proven. 

That evening as he brushed his teeth, he could hear the traffic outside his
house through the open windows. When he moved to his house ten years ago,
the street was mostly quiet. Now there always seemed to be cars on the
street with substantial traffic each morning and evening.  Where had all
these cars come from he wondered and where were they all going?

James hated cars. He hated them because of what they had done to Tim. He
hated their noise. He hated their smell. He hated how they dominated his
city divi into tiny blocks and that no matter where you went you were
constatly crossing these giant swaths of asphault. He hated how they lined
every street filling every vacant nook replacing humans as the most
prominate urban feature. 

The next morning, he stood waiting to crosss the cross his street to catch
the bus to work. This morning it seemed to take even longer than usual to
find a break in the traffic. When the street was finally clear he started
across, but just then a car came out from a side street. It headed down the
opposite side of the street in his direction. Instead of walking back to
the sidewalk to wait again, he stopped where he was in the lane and waited
for the car to pass.  But the car was followed by another and now there was
now a car coming toward him on his side of the street. He didn't move. He
just stood there and waited.  The car coming toward him stopped and within
a short time more cars backed up behind it. Since there were still cars
traveling on the opposite side of the street, he just stood there.  

After about twenty seconds, one of the cars began to honk, but James did
not move. He began to feel as though he couldn't move as though he needed
to be there, as though he were now a fixture in the pavement. Even when
there was break in the traffic on the other side of the street, he just
stood there. A few cars tried to race around him when it was clear. James
just stood there looking straight ahead. And as he stood there he started
to smile to himself. He smiled at how fragile the whole system suddenly
seemed, how one man standing in one lane of a street could, in under a few
minutes, cause cars to back up farther then he could see.

He also thought about his neighbors watching him. He thought about the people
in the cars watching him. He wondered if anyone he knew could see him standing
there in the street. He wondered what they would think. He figured they would
just think he was crazy. Not a bad assumption he thought.

A few minutes later he heard a siren. He was certain they were coming to
remove him from the street and he felt some relief that there was now a
definite resolution to his situation, a way to move him out of the street.
He almost smiled as he noticed the difficultly the police car had getting
through the traffic, but thought it best not to betray any emotion.

The police car stopped near him and the officers both got out. One started to
direct traffic around him and the other came over to ask if he was okay. He
said he was and the officer asked if he would mind moving back to the side
walk. James agreed and walked off the street escorted by the officer.

The officer asked him why he was standing in the street and he said he
didn't know. He said he was tired and confused. His wife and daughter
where inside the house. He could see them watching him, afraid to come out.  

The officer did not feel the need to site James for any violation, but
walked him back to his house where his wife Brenda came out to meet them on
the steps. The officer suggested to Brenda that she take James to the
emergency room so that he could be evaluated. She agreed and they went back
inside.

Brenda was worried. But James said that he was just trying to cross the
street, and got stuck halfway, not sure what to do. He said he hadn't very
slept well for the past few nights. It was the kind of explanation that
only made sense if you wanted it to make sense. Brenda looked at him
without saying anything. James said he was fine and headed off to work
again, but agreed to walk down to the intersection and cross at the
crosswalk.

That evening when he got home from work the house felt even quiter than
usual.  Brenda was in the kitchen making dinner. His daughter had gone to a
friend's house for the night. His relationship with his daughter had become
strained over the last year or was it years.  He could not remember. He
could remember that there was a time when she would run to hug him as soon
as he came in the door.  He had heard that this change was just typical
adolescent behavior, but he could not help thinking that it was somehow his
fault.

He talked with his wife about his day, but not about the morning. She had
some news about her sister's divorce and her plans to move back to the city
to be near them. After dinner he said he wanted to go for a bike ride. She
let him go. She had been more than accomodating over the past year as he
tried to find his way back to a normal life. Though he wondered how long
this would last.

It was the beginning of summer and the days were long. He walked his bike
to the end of the driveway and instead of trying to cross the traffic, he
set off in its flow. He had only recently taken up riding a bike again. The
last time he owned a bike was in collge. He still felt nervous and awkward
never sure where he belonged between the traffic and parked cars. Never
really feeling safe. He rode slowly and carefully and followed the newly
painted bike lanes farther into the city. 

As he the buildings were larger and . He felt tense but this was good. He
still felt like a novice. There were lots of people on bikes these days and
there seemed to be a sort of very cool bike culture. All these people
seemed to know much more than him. He probably looked like a dork, but he
could not tell. He tried to figure out. His bike was not that old, but he
purchased it used. It had a lot of features and gears, but did not look
like the bikes the cool people rode. The sun was low in the sky
highlighting all the features with a soft contrast. The night was cool. He
liked being out and not inside a car. 

It was getting late and he was starting to head back home. Behind him he
began to hear people shouting, whooping and ringing bells. He could tell
they were on bikes because the noise was quickly closing in on him. Then
they were all around him dressed in clothing that was, mutted, freyed and
studded with metal and exposing seemingly random expanses of skin. Their
hair seemed to be cut in geometric patterns and they wore tatoos on their
exposed skin. He the found himself riding among them and feeling very self
conscious. They seemed to be intentionally keeping pace with him.  A few
smiled at him as if inviting him to join their fun.

Surrounded by bikes he noticed he was no longer worried about either
traffic or parked cars. He had drifted more out into the lane away from the
parked cars but remained within their protective shell against traffic.  As
they approached a traffic light the group stopped, though some continued to
ride in small circles as they waited for the light to change.  They were
loud. They wanted to be seen. They wanted to be heard. But again he felt
safe and calm. There was no human uncertaintly in the events revolving
around him. The war was on and they were fighting it. 

As they waited for the light to change, the car directly behind them began
to honk its horn in an aggresive manner that meant get out of the road. The
light was still red. The group began to focus its attention on this car.
Answering each honk with shouts, yells and their own bells. Finally, the
driver leaned out of his window and yelled, "Get out of the road."

As the light turned green, most of the group moved on but the five bikes
that had been circling continued to circle in front of the car. James
stayed with them standing over his bike in the lane and in front of the car
and looked ahead. This time he was not alone. The car gunned its engine and
honked and then pushed forward into one of bikes knocking rider off and
damaging the bike.  The rider quickly jumped up, picked up his bike and
threw it at the front window of the car cracking the windsheild. He and
second rider were quickly at the drivers side of the car. One of them
reached in and opened the door and grabbed the driver.

The other bikers continued to ride but now in circles around the car, their
friends and the driver. James just stood over his back but was now looking
back at the scene. 

The two men pulled the driver from his seat. A woman who had been sitting
beside him screamed. Once out of the car, they were shouting at driver and
pushing him back and forth between them. They stopped him as he tried to
run. Then one grabbed him from behind while the and the other punched him
in the chest and in the face. The sound was nothing like James had ever
heard before. 

Just then they began to hear the wail of a siren in the distance. One of
the bikers said, "Come on Jason, lets go." Another said, "Jay, lets get out
of here." The man holding the driver dropped him on the pavement near the
car and got on his bike. The other man whose bike had been damged by the
car walked over to James and pushed him to the ground. He picked up Jame's
bike and rode off with the other four.

When James stood up a woman was yelling at him. It was not the woman from
the car but another woman who had joined the scene. The woman from the car
was looking distraught and being consoled by another person. was with the
driver lying in the street along with a few other pedestrians who where
attending to him. Another person was trying to consol the woman from the
car. 

People who were simply pedestrians suddenly take on take on new roles as if
they were internally assigned. 

James noticed that at the scene of an accident an audience forms and actors
emerge from the to take on roles to fill out the scene. The woman yelling
at him had taken on the role of defending the victim by James decided that
it was time to leave and turned to make his way through the crowd. The
woman did not follow him, afraid to leave the stage.

James was born.
