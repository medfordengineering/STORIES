From his office window, James watched as a woman across the street
yelled at a man sitting on a bench. He couldn't hear her yell, but he
could see her arms raised and her fists clenched and her mouth open and
her eyes looking down on him as if she might consume him at any moment.
The man looked up and watched her, but did not seem all that concerned. 

The drama across the street was nothing new. James had seen it play out
everyday since he moved into his office four years ago. The cast of
characters varied throughout the year, though there were a few regulars.
Their numbers increased in the summer months and dwindled in the winter.
He had heard that there was a methadone clinic nearby by way of an
explanation.

They were mostly white, but of assorted shapes, sizes, ages and genders.
They would shout, laugh, gesture, dance, cajole, negotiate, argue, yell
and sometimes even fight, but never to any great effect.  They wore
jackets, pants, sun dresses and skirts, and held hand bags and cell phones
just like everyone else, but they were not like everyone else.

Their lives were not punctuated by the usual changes of venue associated
with work day, evening and weekend.  Their lives unfolded continuously in
this one location each day from morning to night like actors on a
perpetual stage playing for no one but James or so it seemed to him, for
no one else ever seemed to notice them.  

What amazed James most was that they always seemed to be engaged in
conversations, often of apparently vital importance. James wondered what
could be so important. What dramatic conflict was mounting or being
resolved in lives that seemed to have no external consequence. By
contrast, James's generally found any conversation lasting more than
twenty minutes usually required work.

As James looked out his window and watched, his thoughts drifted to his
son. For the past year, he had looked out his window and thought about his
son. For the past year, he has also done so little work, that he felt he
should have been fired or, at the very least, moved to a desk without a
window. He could only assume that his manager felt sorry for him and that
when she weighed the emotional cost of firing him against monetary cost of
his lack of productivity, he came out slightly ahead. He wasn't planning
to argue with her on this point.

Someone had once told him that after a year, you either move on or you
don't.  James was not moving on. A year ago, James's son was hit by car and
killed as he was walking home from school. The driver was not drunk or
senile, just careless and young.

That evening at home as he brushed his teeth before going to bed, he
listened to the sound of traffic outside the open bathroom window. The
sound was not so steady that he couldn't make out the individual vehicles,
a truck then a bus, then a series of cars each with a distinct sound and
direction. In most cases, it was not just the sound of the car's engine or
any sort of mechanical noise that he heard, but the woosh the car made as
it pushed through the sea of air, creating waves that spread like the wake
from a boat. They entered his house through windows and walls and
expending their energy against everything in their path. 

And even late at night when the volume of traffic on his street was
reduced to only a whisper, there remained the constant and pervasive hum
that resulted from a synthesis of the waves from all the traffic for miles
around leaving no possibility for silence.

The next morning, James stood waiting to cross his street to catch the bus
to work. When he and his wife had moved to this house ten years ago, the
street was mostly quiet. Now there always seemed to be traffic. Where had
all these cars come from he wondered and where were they all going?

It seemed to take even longer than usual to find a break in the traffic.
First there was traffic on one side of the street and then on the other.
When the street was finally clear on both sides he started across, but just
then a car came out from a side street and moving in his direction.
Instead of walking back to the sidewalk, he just stopped where he was in
the street and waited for the car to pass in front of him.  But this car
was followed by another and now there was now a car coming toward him in
the lane where he was standing. He didn't move. He just stood there and
waited.  The car coming toward him stopped and within a short time more
cars backed up behind it. There were still cars traveling on the opposite
side of the street, and so he just stood there.  

After about twenty seconds, one of the cars began to honk, but James did
not move. He began to feel as though he couldn't move as though he needed
to be there, as though he were now a fixture in the pavement.  Even when
there was break in the traffic on the other side of the street, he just
stood there. A few cars tried to dart around him. James just stood there
looking straight ahead. And as he stood there he started to smile to
himself. He smiled at how fragile the whole system suddenly seemed. He
smiled at how one man standing in one lane of a street could, in only a few
minutes, cause cars to back up farther then he could see.

He also thought about his neighbors watching him. He thought about the
people in the cars watching him. He wondered if anyone he knew could see
him standing there in the street. He wondered what they would think. He
figured they would just think he was crazy. Not a bad assumption he
thought.

A few minutes later he heard a siren. He was certain they were coming to
remove him from the street. He felt some relief that there was now a
definite resolution to his situation, one from which he seemed unable to
extricate himself. He almost smiled as he noticed the difficultly the
police car had getting through the traffic, but thought it best not to
betray any emotion.

The police car stopped near him and the officers both got out. One started
to direct traffic around him and the other came over to ask if he was okay.
He said he was and the officer asked if he would mind moving back to the
side walk. James agreed and walked off the street escorted by the officer.

The officer asked him why he was standing in the street and he said he
didn't know. He said he was tired and confused. Looking toward his house,
he could see his wife and daughter inside. He could see them watching him,
embarrassed to come out.  

The officer did not feel the need to site James for any violation, but
walked him back to his house where his wife Sarah had come out to meet
them on the steps. The officer suggested to Sarah that she take James to
the emergency room so that he could be evaluated. She agreed and they went
back inside.

Sarah was worried. James said that he was just trying to cross the street,
and got stuck halfway, not sure what to do. He said he hadn't very slept
well for the past few nights. It was the kind of explanation that only made
sense if you wanted it to make sense. Sarah looked at him without saying
anything. James said he was fine and headed off to work again, but agreed
to walk down to the intersection and cross at the crosswalk.

That evening when he got home from work he found Sarah in the kitchen
making dinner. His daughter had gone to a friend's house for the night. He
felt relieved by her absence and then guilty. His relationship with his
daughter had become strained over the last year or was it years.  He could
not remember.  He could remember that there was a time when she would run
to hug him as soon as he came in the door. He had heard that the change in
their relationship was just typical adolescent behavior, but he could not
help thinking that it was somehow his fault.

He asked his wife about their plans for the weekend. Not that he cared, he
simply wanted to fill the silence. She said she had talked with her sister,
who was getting divorced and that she might come visit. She had plans to
move back to the city to be near them. This topic carried the conversation
through dinner. After dinner he said he wanted to go for a bike ride. She
let him go. She had been more than accommodating over the past year as he
tried to find his way back to a normal life.  Though he wondered how long
this would last.

It was early summer and the days were long. He walked his bike to the end
of the driveway and instead of trying to cross the traffic, he set off in
its flow. He had only recently taken up riding a bike again. The last time
he owned a bike was in college. He still felt nervous riding in the street,
he was either too close to the cars in the street or too close to the cars
parked on the side of the road and never exactly sure where he belonged. 

As he headed into the city the buildings grew larger and closer together.
There were more vehicles and more lanes of traffic. There were lanes for
turning left and right and going straight making it all the more
complicated. He decided it was time to turn back, but just as he was about
to turn, he heard from behind him people shouting, whooping and ringing
bells. He could tell they were on bikes because the noise was quickly
closing in on him.  

Suddenly they were all around him. They were young and tough and harsh and
loud. They wore clothes that were dark and made from denim and leather and
metal. A few of them smiled at him as if inviting him to join their fun,
but most just ignored him. They were focused the on the world around them,
making sure the world knew they existed.

As they carried him along in their wake, James no longer felt nervous about
his place in the street.

The group came to a traffic light and stopped. James stopped with them.
Some stood over their bikes, but others continued to ride around in circles
as if they were too nervous to stop. As they waited for the light to
change, the car directly behind them honked its horn and the group answered
with shouts and bells and jeers. The car honked again and again the group
responded with even more noise. The light was still red. The group began to
focus its attention on the car answering each honk with increased
attention. Finally, the driver leaned out of his window and yelled, "Get
the hell out of the road."

As the light turned green, most of the group moved on but five of the bikes
that had been circling continued to circle in front of the car. James
stayed with them standing over his bike in the lane and in front of the car
and looked ahead. This time he was not alone. The car gunned its engine and
honked and then it pushed forward into one of bikes knocking the rider off.
The rider quickly jumped up, picked up his bike and threw it at the front
window of the car cracking the windshield. He and a second rider were
quickly at the drivers side of the car. One of them reached in and opened
the door and grabbed the driver.

The other bikers continued to ride in circles around the entire scene which
now included the car, their two friends, James and the driver. James just
stood over his bike but was now looking back at what was happening.

The two men pulled the driver from his seat. A woman who had been sitting
beside him screamed. Once out of the car, they were shouting at driver and
pushing him back and forth between them. They stopped him as he tried to
run. Then one grabbed him from behind while the and the other punched him
in the chest and in the face. James watched.

Just then they began to hear the wail of a siren in the distance. One of
the bikers said, "Come on Jason, lets go." Another said, "Jay, lets get out
of here." The man holding the driver dropped him on the pavement near the
car and got on his bike. The other man whose bike had been damaged by the
car walked over to James looked at him for a moment and then pushed him
hard to the ground, picked up James's bike and rode off with the other
four.

When James stood up a woman was yelling at him. The driver of the car was
lying on the ground and not moving. The woman from the car was next to the
man on the ground and crying. A young man was consoling the woman from the
car, another man and woman were attending to the driver, an older man was
trying to keep back the crowd that had formed. People who only moments ago
had been pedestrians were now playing important roles in the dramatic scene
that had unfolded around him, as if actors, James thought walked among
pedestrians always ready for their part in any play.

James turned to leave. The woman continued to shout at him but remained
where she stood, seemingly willing to leave her mark on the stage. The
crowd hesitantly made way for his exit, uncertain if this was part of the
script.

James decided to walk home. As he made his way down the sidewalk, the scene
of the accident slowly faded behind him and into the general wash of the
city. He was in no hurry to get home, but was glad to have a destination.
His hand throbbed from where he had landed on it when he fell. The blood
from a scrape was already starting to dry. He noticed that his shirt was
torn and there was bike grease on his pants. But cloaked in the city and in
the night he felt relatively inconspicuous.

As he walked, his mind sorted through the jumble of events that made up his
day. He tried to arrange these events into a logical sequence of cause and
effect. Why was he standing in the street? Why did he tell his wife he was
just tired?  Why did the two men fight? Why did he get punched? None of his
questions seemed to have an answer.

Frustrated in his thoughts, his attention was drawn to the scenes that
played out around him in the late hours of night. Two boys and a girl
walked in his direction, young and drunk, a lazy knot of arms that
swayed and laughed as they made their way past. A group of people well
dressed and anxious, lined up against a long dark wall and waiting for
their turn to enter a night club. A man with silver hair in suit and tie
left a liquor store holding a bottle in a paper bag. The name of the
store spelled out in bright bulbs and neon trim.  Across the street, a
group of boys hopped, danced and spun down the sidewalk with gusto but
not urgency. A car with girls inside drove by. The boys shouted for
their attention. Between them a bottle was tossed and broke in the
street, but from which party, James could not tell. 

James felt he shared little more with these people than species.

As James neared his home, hungry and in no rush, he decided to stop at a
sandwich shop and get a slice of pizza. Inside a young couple sat at a
booth next to the window. The boy ate a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs
in a watery tomato sauce and the girl watched a television set behind
his head. In another booth an older man had fallen asleep, but bothering
no one, he was left alone. 

Two men in aprons worked behind the counter. Both short in stature with
dark hair and forearms thick from generations of use. One called to the
other in a language the James did not understand. James assumed they
were brothers and that they were from Italy or Greece. The girl pointed
to something on the television. The boy turned to look, nodded and then
went back to his bowl of spaghetti. James placed his order. The man
handed him his change. James wanted to say something more. He wanted to
ask him a question about where he was from or maybe how long he had
worked there.  He had been to the shop many times before and had seen
other customers chat informally with the men behind the counter. But
James could think of nothing to say and so he took his change and sat
down to eat his slice of pizza.

As he approached his house he noticed a police car in the driveway. He
started to run toward the house and then stopped. The police car was
quiet and empty indicating no sense of emergency. He also did not relish
another encounter with the police. The lights of his first floor were
on. His mind raced through what could have brought them to his house.
There had been burglaries in the neighborhood. Maybe his house had been
robbed. Then the image of the man lying in the street came back into his
consciousness. Was it possible that the man was dead? This was something
he had not considered. Could the police be looking for him? Could they
have found him? It all did not seem possible. And yet there the police
car sat in his driveway in the middle of the night.

He was now close enough to his house to see inside. Under the bright
artificial light of his living room, his wife was standing talking to
two police officers. He watched them trying to get a better sense of the
nature of their conversation from how they stood and how they moved. He
imagined what they might be saying and even though he imagined himself
the subject of the conversation he still felt as if he were simply
observing a scene in which he had no part.

Inside his house, the same officer who had been there in the morning was
saying to his wife that in order to even file a missing person report, her
husband would to have been missing for at least 24 hours. He also reminded
her that she should have taken him to the emergency room as he suggested.
He promised he would keep a look out and would file an official report as
soon as he could.

James saw the police officers turn to leave. He turned and ran both
quickly and quietly down the driveway. He would return when the police
were gone and his wife was asleep.

A half hour later, he quietly entered and made his way to his bedroom.
Without waking his wife, he slipped into his bed and waited sleep to
erase the day. 

At exactly 7:30, their alarm clock began its steady beat but for a few
minutes was unable to rouse either James or Sarah. Finally Sarah, usually a
light sleeper, pulled herself out of slumber.  Seeing James lying next to
her, she began to rock him awake saying "James, it is 7:30" and then, as he
sat up and looked at her trying to focus, she asked him, "What happened to
you last night?  When did you get home?" James explained about the bike
accident and that he had walked home. As he told his story, she examined
his wounded hand. Holding it, he watched as she gently traced the outline
of his scraped skin. 

She then looked up at him and asked "Are you alright?" "Yes, I am fine."
he lied. "Why didn't you call me? Don't you think I worry?" she asked.
He responded that by the time he thought to call she would have been
asleep, an excuse which neither he nor she believed. `	

"I called the police." she said. "Oh" he said. "I didn't know what else
to do." she said shaking her head. "Why are you doing this?" she asked
in a different tone, one that made him think she had finally had enough.
He wondered why it had taken her so long.  "Doing what?" he said.
"Don't you know that I feel everything you feel, that I also think about
him every day and that every time I think about him my heart aches with
a pain so deep that I don't know how I will survive it." She paused
looking at him. "Are you going to go on like this forever?" She asked.
He said he didn't want to but he was not even sure if that was true.
"Because I don't think I can take it anymore." she said still looking
directly at him.

She looked at his hand again, she had not stopped holding it. "Does it
hurt?" "A little" he said, relieved to be asked a question that he could
finally answer honestly.

On his way to work he sat on the bus thinking that maybe today would be
different. Though he could think of no evidence to support this. He
looked at the scab on his hand. Yesterday was real, he thought.

He made it to work on time. That was one thing you could say for him he
thought as he sat down at his desk at 9am. He was never late for work.
He looked at the stack of folders that were waiting for him. Each folder
contained an insurance claim that he needed to review. Each one a
complaint about some minor tragedy and a demand for monetary
compensation. Tragedies that were perpetrated by acts of God or
criminals and directed at the sorts of objects that could be repaired,
rebuilt or replaced, but never made the same. That was how the world
worked, he thought. Nothing ever returned to its original state.  

His job was to find the flaw in the applicant's story, evidence that
their loss was not as tragic as claimed and he had been good at his job.

Toward the middle of the afternoon, he got a call from a secretary
requesting that he meet with Denise, the division supervisor at the end
of the day.  She was his boss's boss. He had only met with her a few
times before. Once when he was first hired.

As he entered her office, she was just finishing a phone call. She
pointed to a seat in front of her desk. After putting down the phone,
she asked him how he was doing. She said she was sorry for his loss and
that it must be terrible.  She looked at him with that same sort of
smile that he had seen on so many other faces as if she were trying to
imitate his sadness. It seemed to him an odd human instinct that was
both impossible and pointless.

She then looked down at some papers and began to review his job
performance over the past year. It then dawned on him what was
happening. She reviewed the numbers of claims he had processed over
various periods of time. Apparently for one six-week period, he had done
absolutely nothing. She talked about understanding and responsibility.
As she spoke, he heard himself respond acknowledging everything she said
and he felt himself slowly rising as if he were no longer in his chair
but looking down on her from a few feet above his chair. She did not
seem to notice. All he wanted was for the conversation to be over. He
wanted her to stop. If he had had a white flag he would have waved it.
Finally he heard her say, "I'm sorry." which seemed to indicate that she
was finished. He said "Thank you" and left. 

As he made his way back to his desk he felt the weight of no one looking at
him. 

At his his desk, he stared at the stack of unprocessed claims. Why had
they given him so many? Were they offering him one last chance to prove
that he still had what it took to be a productive member of the company?
If so, then why not tell him? He could have risen to the occasion. He
might have, he thought.  

He picked up a photo of his family that he kept in the top drawer and
put it in his shirt pocket. He looked around, not sure what else to
take. There was nothing else that was his. He did not want to be accused
of stealing. 

He looked around the room. He thought maybe he should say goodbye to
someone. Over the past year, he had stopped talking with the few people
he knew and it seemed like an awkward time to start.

A few minutes later a security guard who had been standing across the
room came over to him and asked him for his identity badge.  The guard
called him "sir." He knew the guard's name. "Donald" was printed above
the pocket on his uniform, but in all the years at the company James had
never spoken to him. Donald escorted him out of the building and
before closing the door behind him said, "Have an nice evening, sir." 

James stood outside the building squinting into the low sun that peaked
under dark clouds moving in from the West. Across the street a familiar
woman was laughing. James turned to watch her.  She was laughing in a
way that carried her body forward and then back as she tried to maintain
balance rocking from one foot to the other. "What could she be laughing
at?" James thought. Maybe she was laughing at him.  Maybe she knew that
he had lost his job. Maybe she was, in fact, a siren, who had for the
past year patiently drawn his attention from his work until finally he
stood outside his office, the door closed and locked behind him.

With nowhere else to go, James crossed the street. The woman stopped
laughing. It seemed that her joke had run its course. Her objective
realized she would turn her attention to another unsuspecting employee
who had the misfortune to sit at a desk overlooking the plaza. 

As he sat and watched, most her friends (or acquaintances he was never
sure how to think of them) were scattered around the plaza in groups of
twos and threes. The remainder flitted about between these small groups
pausing for conference as if to mimic a larger and more complex social
structure.

He pulled the picture from his pocket. His wife and daughter looked at
him.  They were smiling, but then didn't everyone smile in pictures?
What were they thinking? What was there to think? He pulled his wallet
from his pocket.  Whatever value it contained no longer belonged to him.
He placed the photo in the wallet.  He had heard that a wallet found in
a mailbox would be returned to its owner. He walked to the corner of the
plaza and tossed the wallet in a mailbox.

He returned his attention to the people in the plaza. He wondered where
they went at night. Didn't everyone go somewhere at night? He wondered
if when darkness fell complete, they just slowly came to a halt, like
windup creatures whose springs had finally exhausted enough energy that
they could no longer overcome the friction of their gears, and stood
resting motionless until their caretaker came round before dawn to wind
them back up again. 

It began to rain, a light but steady rain. Unprepared their world
quickly dissolved as they left their posts and gathered together in the
middle of the plaza. After a brief conference the majority headed off
together downtown. James followed.

They made a cumbersome group moving down the sidewalk. Sometimes three
and four abreast, sometimes spilling into the street. Every couple of
blocks the group would stop to adjust itself, like an old man stopping
to hike up his sagging trousers.

After about dozen blocks, they stopped and joined a line. The line lead
to the entrance of a large rectangular building efficiently constructed
from concrete and steel. It sat among a mix of buildings, mostly far
older and built of brick and stone and at a time when the hand of a
craftsman still held value. James wondered what tragedy had befallen the
building that previously occupied this space.

The rain remained light, but the crowd was anxious to enter the building
before it got worse. James asked the woman in front of him if she knew
when the building opened. The woman turned to face James. Close up she
looked older than she had seemed from afar. Her face tan from a life
spent outside. Her eyes rested in their sockets as if waiting for
something to arouse them from their slumber. James tried to imagine her
as a new born baby. Everyone was a new born baby once, he thought.

She said it opened at 7pm and added, "but ya'd think the bastards would
open up a little early with the rain." James agreed. 

At exactly 7pm the doors opened and people began to file in. By then the
line behind James extended to the end of the block. Inside, the lobby
was crowded, bright and humid from warm bodies and wet clothes. As a
first time guest, James was required to meet with an in-take councilor
and stood in line with other first time guests.

He felt in his pocket. He had no wallet and no ID. Would he need one to
stay here? All these people can't have identification he thought? He
needed a name. Jacob. Jacob Jackson or JJ for short. It was a good name,
he thought. He was surprised how easily it came to him. He rehearsed the
name in his head as he stood in line.

Inside a private room, James sat across from the councilor. The
councilor asked him for some identification. James said he did not have
any. The truth. He lost his wallet. A lie. The councilor paused and
looked at him suspiciously over his glasses, "Well it is not a
requirement for a bed in the shelter but it is helpful." He said but did
not explain why. "First and last name?" "Jacob, Jacob Jackson, my
friends call me JJ." James responded. "Date of birth?" "Last permanent
address?" "Are you taking any medication?" "Do you have employment?"
"Are you married?" "Are you receiving any treatment for drug addiction?"
James answered the questions with a mix of truth and fiction. "Who
should we contact in case of a medical emergency?" James paused. "No
one." The councilor looked up from the form. "No brothers, no sisters,
an aunt, a cousin?" "No." said James.

The councilor gave James two small slips of paper with numbers on them.
One was for his bed assignment and the other for fresh clothing. He then
directed James toward the men's unit. The lobby had mostly emptied out.
A few people, clearly intoxicated where being directed out of the
shelter.

Entering the men's unit he was first required to take a shower. The
showers were along one wall of an open stall and were overseen by
shelter staff. Five men stood naked washing their bodies with soap.
James could not remember ever seeing a grown man naked before.  They
looked comical. Devoid of clothing their bodies were a mix of curves and
lines intersecting abruptly in a way that showed no elegance of form,
creatures who long-ago stopped relying on their bodies for food and
power. James undressed slowly, hesitant to expose his own inelegant form
to judgement.

After the shower he was able to pick out some fresh clothes. He choose
corduroy pants and a checked shirt. He had not worn corduroy pants since
he was a kid and had never owned a checked shirt. The waist of the pants
a bit too small. The collar of the shirt a bit to large. 

The dormitory was an open room the size of a gymnasium and filled with
cots in neat rows and columns. He took a fresh blanket and sheet and
found the number 36 that identified his assigned cot. It was located
near the center of the room. He wondered how others were able to get
more choice locations. He sat on his cot for moment and looked around.
Most of the other men had belongings of some sort that they placed under
their cots.

paperback from a large shelf under a sign painted Library and found his
assigned cot. It was now 7pm. He had three hours till lights out. Still
there were a few people around the room already snoring in their cots. 

As he looked around the room for the first time, he noticed that many of
the men fit his stereotype, but a smaller number did not. He could not help
staring at the people who he felt looked like him and wondering what had
brought them here. 




Why do they get them in early to bed and early to rise as if by modeling
behavior they will gain the attributes of healthy, wealthy and wise. But
maybb





James stands at the end of his driveway and looks back at his house from
behind a juniper bush. Maybe he is daring the police to catch him. Maybe he
wants them to catch him. Suddenly he sees one of the officers at his front
door. James turns and runs down the sidewalk. At the first side street, he
turns, toward the end of the street he ducks into a dark parking lot.  He
sits down against a fence hidden by a dumpster and laughs quietly feeling
like a child who has just escaped in a game of hide and seek. It is the
first time he can remember laughing in months.

Sitting, hidden, he now has time to question his actions, but all he tells
himself is that her sister is coming to live and will make a far better
partner than he. He gets up. He must disappear.

He needs to sleep to find a place to sleep. He has never stayed up all
night and this 

Even though he no need to be at work in the morning, it
is a tough habit to break.


He needed to sleep. After 30 years of sleeping every night it was a hard
On the street he is moving quickly away from home but to where? His first
thought is that he needs to find a place to sleep for the night, but then
challenges this thought. Is this just a convention, the sort of convention
to which he is no longer obliged? He has no plans to go to work in the
morning or any plans whatsoever. 

ot going to work in the morning. so why sleep?  could just stay up all
night, sleep on the subway when he got tired. No, his present need for
sleep is real, but where? James' world is one where people sleep indoors.
They sleep in their rooms and they sleep in their Ieds. They sleep safely
protected under walls and sheets and blankets.

He could find a hotel. He has some money. No, he no longer has any more
money than the cash in his wallet. He is disappearing 

He needs to be where he does not stand out. He needs to leave this world.
This world has homes. It is not that he will be seen or recognized. No one
knows him. Even his neighbors would barely recognize him. It is that he
would stand out. But there is no one to see him. He needs protection.  

The streets were quiet. He walked in the hours between good and bad, when
the bad had given up and gone to bed and the good were still waiting for
the dawn to start their day.

Once in the park, he followed the path around a small pond. The moon
provided more light than he had imagined. Leaving the path near a small
wooded hill, he scouted for a location that would offer the most privacy.
As he left the path he became aware of the sound of his footsteps, but he
was certain there was no one around to hear him.

He settled on a spot near a rock that provided some protection though it
was unclear who else would be coming through the park at night. He simply
lay down on the ground moving a few rocks and sticks until he felt
reasonably comfortable. He would need to be gone early in the morning. He
guessed that joggers would be in the park by 6am. He decided he would take
the first bus into the city. Getting up early had never been a problem. He
was sure he would be up at first light. As he closed his eyes he could hear
the constant hum of an expressway not far from the park.

The next morning he was up even before the sun and made his way to the bus
stop. On the bus were mostly those who were starting a morning shift or
leaving a night shift. People who worked in occupations that were open
around the clock or people who where just riding somewhere like him. He
felt out of place, but no one paid much attention to him. He inventoried
his needs, clothing, shelter and food.

He felt uncomfortable in his clothes like they were part of a different
world than the one he was entering. A kid a few seats in front of him wore
a mohawk and a large studded jacket, no one paid much attention to him
either.

His first destination was a Goodwill that operated downtown. He tried to
pick out clothes that he would not have normally picked out and that maybe
did not fit quite right. Maybe he just needed to be in clothes that were
not his. His purcahse included a hat. The new clothes cost him a total of
$15 dollars.  He put his old ones in his backpack.

His next stop was a diner. It was already noon and he was famished. He knew
he should save his money, but he was not quite ready to go to a meal
program nor did he know where to find one. For this meal he would use the
money in his wallet, but that was not going to last. As he scanned the menu
he tried to estimate dollars per calorie and tried to find the best deal.
After he ordered his meal, he looked in his wallet at all the cards that
identified him. He separated them into a stack and placed them in his
outside pocket.  He would drop them in the first trashcan he found. 

After his meal he headed downtown to find a place to stay for the night. He
knew the name of at least one shelter, but did not know where it was
located. He wandered around downtown for a while hoping to just happen
across a shelter, but did not find anything. He then found a payphone with
a yellow page book attached and was able to look up an address. He walked
to make sure he could find the place. Now that he knew where he needed to
go he decided to head to the city library for a place to spend the day. 

The library had been built in the 1920s and was one of the majestic
buildings of the city. The large cool open space of the great room retained
its elegance as the city went through transformations from rich to poor and
back again. James just wandered the shelves looking for a book to read.
Choosing a book was always hard. He finally found something to read and
settled into a chair on the second floor of the building near a window. 

For the moment, his life seemed pretty good. Less than five pages into the
book he fell asleep. His head leaned back against the chair. He awoke two
hours latter and spent the rest of the afternoon reading. Around 6pm he
decided to leave and head over to the shelter, nervous about the night
ahead.

He arrived at the shelter around


Sitting at the table he began to notice his hands and his skin. This was
skin that had spent most of its life out of the sun. It was smooth and
unweathered. Any cuts he had received had been carefully attended to so
that little if any scaring remained. His hands were not caloused from
manual labor. Even more so, he thought about his teeth that were all in
place and neatly ordered. These physical attributes he could not alter nor
disguise and they defined him as someone who had lived a comfortable and
affluent life. He would try to cover them up as best he could.

With no job and no money, he had not choice about his place in society.
With each niche there were requirements such as age, race and income.
Certain ones were only achieved by income. Some you just fell into by age
or social status. He could no more be a punk or valley girl. Though all of
these required some income, if only for the basic attire that the social
class expected. The status of homeless or transient required no capital of
any kind. In fact, it was the requirement. In that way it was a sort of
exclusive club. You could visit or pretend, but you could not truly belong
if you had capital assets. 

The next night after he stayed in the park he was waiting in line for
transport to one of the city shelters. He was not sure which shelter he
was going to but he had seen people lining up here for years and knew that
these were where people lined up to go to shelters for the evening. As the
line moved forward people were checked for intoxication. Even here levels
of status remained and he fit in the right crowd.

When he arrived at the shelter he was assigned a cot in the men's room. He
immediately recognized people. Some of the people who he saw outside his
window. Here the formed a group of friends, a clique and did not mingle
much with the others. Just the men. They generally seemed more subdued
here. He was able to get a meal and a shower.      

He did not have a bag for his belongings, because he had no belongings and
this alone set him apart. 

His days continued like this for a while. It seemed so easy to hide in
plain site. He spent his days at the library and nights in the shelter. He
was not well fed, but was not starving either. He was not sure how long it
would last before someone recognized him.

But where was he going. What was the goal of this exercise. He had always
had a purpose or at least a path and direction. But now there seemed to be
no path. He was not moving forward. He had a pattern to his day but there
was no sense of progressing. He felt that he was in a holding pattern
circling in the sky and waiting to land or waiting for what would happen
next. And this made him anxious.
 




He sat in the new section of the library with windows that looked onto the
street. The old section had been built for the purpose of the secure
storage of books and general access. The new portion of the library had
been build as a public space in the model of a cutting edge department
store with three floors of products and glass walls looking out on the
public. 

Sitting in his usual spot, James looked out over the sidewalk. As he did he
noticed two people walking down the sidewalk together. One was pushing a
bike. He immediately recognized them as two of the bikers from the evening
of the incident. One was the guy who held the driver of the car and the
other was one of the girls. At first he froze afraid they might see him,
but then he realized he needed to follow them.  


quickly decided to follow them. He was excited by the prospect
of finding out where they lived and about contacting them.

He made his way out of the library and down to the sidewalk behind them.
They walked for blocks through the city. The walked into an urban
neighborhood just outside the city. They walked father than most people
walked. He imagined himself as a detective, but they did not seem to be
suspicious. As he followed them he imagined meeting them and what he would
say.

They reached a two family home that looked as if it were rented to students
and went inside. James stood on the street near the house and could not
decide what to do. He thought about in college how he and some friends had
walked to party, but then stood outside the house afraid to go in. He felt
self conscious in his new role and was now out side of his routine not sure
how he looked standing on the street.    

Finally, he went up and knocked on the door. After a few minutes a woman
answered and opened the door just enough to . He recognized her from the
evening. She was one of the ones who had smiled at him when they first
began riding together. She did not seem to recognize him and he became
again aware of his disguise. "How can I help you" she said in tone that
assumed she was in no way interested in helping him. "I was at the
accident" he said. "What accident?" "The one where the man in the car hit
your friends bike and then was pulled from the car." He did not want to add
and then beaten. Her eyes narrowed slightly as she recognized him and then
she said, "Hold on" and closed the door. He could here people talking
behind the door. She opened the door again.  She asked him "What do you
want?" He said, he wanted to come in. She said, "Sorry, I think you must
have the wrong house." and closed the door. 

James stood there, for a moment wondering if he could be wrong, but no he
was sure. He banged on the door again. There was a pause and then the same
woman answered the door and said, "What do you want, you don't belong
here." and then the man moved beside her in the door way and said, "If you
don't go away we will have you arrested for trespassing." James again said,
"I want to come in." The man exasperated said, "What are you doing here?
You think you saw some people beat up some guy a few weeks ago and you
think someone here looks like one of those people but you are mistaken so
you need to go away." "I don't have anywhere else to go" said James. I have
been living in a shelter since the accident and I won't be able to stay
there for much longer. "Wait, what are you talking about?" said the man.
"You have been living in a shelter? Who are you? Why don't you just go
home." "I can't go home. The police are looking for me." "And why are the
police looking for you?" asked the man in a tone that clearly indicated he
did not believe this. "Because of the accident." he said. "I am desperate."
he added and then "My son was killed by a car." The man rolled his eyes as
if none of this made any sense. Then he and the woman closed the door.
James waited. A few moments later, they opened the door and let him in. The
man said, "If any of this is bullshit, you are dead." The woman said,
"Don't mind Jay, he can be a little dramatic." "Well, we really don't need
another mouth to feed." said Jay. "Don't worry, he doesn't look like he
eats too much" said the other man who had been with Jay at the accident.

The other man, whose name was Jude, brought James down to the basement and
showed him a cot. He said that James should stay there till they called
him. They needed to talk.

Upstairs the five people who had been at the accident and who lived
together in the house sat down on a set of mis-matched living room
furniture. "The guy is crazy" said Jay.  "Well, being crazy is "We don't
need him going to the police." Said Katherine. "So what is going to stop
him" asked Mike. "We just take him with us." said Jay. "He freely comes
along and freely participates in a nights activity. After that, he is going
to be much less likely to go to the police." "Can he really ride a bike?"
asked Jude. "I guess, we'll see." said Jay. "So for now, he just stays in
our basement and eats our food?" asked Mike. "It is bad enough having one
freeloader" said Jude smiling. "I am sure we can find something for him to
do during the day." said Katherine. 

Jude called down the stairs and said that James could come up. They all
introduced themselves. That night he ate a meal that Jay cooked. The next
morning everyone went to work except Jay. Jude and Katherine were
programmers who made a lot of money. Mike worked in a grocery store and
Mary worked as a councilor for teenagers with substance abuse. Jay stayed
home and took care of the house. He was the brains!

He noticed his bike on the back porch. Oh that piece of crap.  

That evening after dinner, Jay asked James if he would like to go on a ride
with them. James said sure. "You could use your own bike" said Jay. 





She said, "Okay" and opened the door to allow
him inside. 

When he came in the guy who had lost his bike at the accident was standing
there just behind her. He said, "So you're the guy whose bike I stole. It
was a total piece of crap." James, just said "sorry" but then realized that
he did not exactly owe him and apology. "No problem" he responded,
accepting the apology. "So what do you want?" said the guy. "I need a place
to stay" he said. "What do you mean?"  "The police are looking for me." "Uh
huh" he said if this was not news to him. "Why do you think we want we
should let you stay here if the police are looking for you?" Here was
exactly the question. He was about to cross over. The silence was heavy.
The police were not looking for them. No one even knew about them or that
they had been at the accident, except for him. James finally answered,
"Because I need a place to stay." The woman said, "Fine, you can sleep on
the couch tonight."

Jude earned the money. By day he worked as a programmer and made enough to
support them all. He did not mind doing this. He enjoyed is work for the
most part and could not believe how much money they gave him. Jenna
volunteered in a soup kitchen. Dala worked as a social worker with
students. 

James was born in a small town in New Hampshire that had slowly made its
way from rural to suburban. He lived with his mother in a house that
belonged to the latter type and of no particular distinction. It resided
within a cluster of houses equally lacking in any sort of character, houses
that weren't designed so much as built. They served their purpose as basic
shelter including places for sleeping, eating and watching television.

James never knew his father although he did not leave the family until
James was two. If he existed at all it was in a sort of hazy, dream-like
memory that could not be distinguished from a photograph.
