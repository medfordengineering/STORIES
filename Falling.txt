From his office window, James watched as a woman across the street
yelled at a man sitting on a bench. He couldn't hear her yell, but he
could see her arms raised and her fists clenched and he could see her
mouth open and her eyes looking down on him as if she might consume him
at any moment. The man looked up at her with only vague interest.

The drama across the street was nothing new. James had seen it play out
everyday since he moved into his office four years ago. The cast of
characters varied throughout the year, though there were a few regulars.
Their numbers increased in the summer months and dwindled in the winter.
He had heard that there was a methadone clinic nearby by way of an
explanation.

They were mostly white, but of assorted shapes, sizes, ages and genders.
They would shout, laugh, gesture, dance, cajole, negotiate, argue, yell
and sometimes even fight, but never to any great effect.  They wore
jackets, pants, sun dresses and skirts, and held hand bags and cell phones
just like everyone else, but they were not like everyone else.

Their lives were not punctuated by the usual changes of venue associated
with work day, evening and weekend.  Their lives unfolded continuously in
this one location each day from morning to night like actors on a
perpetual stage playing for no one but James or so it seemed to him, for
no one else ever seemed to notice them.  

What amazed James most was that they always seemed to be engaged in
conversations, often of apparently vital importance. James wondered what
could be so important. What dramatic conflict was mounting or being
resolved in lives that seemed to have no external consequence. By
contrast, James's generally found any conversation lasting more than
twenty minutes usually required work.

As James looked out his window and watched, his thoughts drifted to his
son. For the past year, he had looked out his window and thought about his
son. For the past year, he has also done so little work, that he felt he
should have been fired or, at the very least, moved to a desk without a
window. He could only assume that his manager felt sorry for him and that
when she weighed the emotional cost of firing him against monetary cost of
his lack of productivity, he came out slightly ahead. He wasn't planning
to argue with her on this point.

Someone had once told him that after a year, you either move on or you
don't.  James was not moving on. A year ago, James's son was hit by car and
killed as he was walking home from school. The driver was not drunk or
senile, just careless and young.

That evening at home as he brushed his teeth before going to bed, he
listened to the sound of traffic outside the open bathroom window. The
sound was not so steady that he couldn't make out the individual
vehicles, a truck then a bus, then a series of cars going up or down the
street. In most cases, it was not the sound of the car's engine or any
sort of mechanical noise that he heard, but the woosh the car made as it
pushed through the air, creating waves like the wake from a boat that
entered his house through windows and walls and expended its energy
against everything in its path. 

That night he woke in the early morning. For the past week, he had been
waking in the middle of the night. Often he could just fall back into
sleep but some nights he lay awake pulled across the dream barrier into
the.. He got up and went to the bathroom. Standing by the open window
there was no longer the sound of cars passing his house, but he could
still hear a steady drone of traffic from an expressway across town. As
he stood quietly, he tried but could not distinguish tease apart the
sound of truck gunning its engine truck from a car, the gunning of a
motor, a truck downshifting all merged into a single perfect tone.

The next morning, James stood waiting to cross his street to catch the bus
to work. When he and his wife had moved to this house ten years ago, the
street was mostly quiet. Now there always seemed to be traffic. Where had
all these cars come from he wondered and where were they all going?

It seemed to take even longer than usual to find a break in the traffic.
First there was traffic on one side of the street and then on the other.
When the street was finally clear on both sides he started across, but
just then a car came out from a side street moving in his direction.
Instead of walking back to the sidewalk, he just stopped where he was in
the street and waited for the car to pass in front of him.  But this car
was followed by another and now there was now a car coming toward him in
the lane where he was standing. He didn't move. He just stood there and
waited.  The car coming toward him stopped and within a short time more
cars backed up behind it. There were still cars traveling on the
opposite side of the street, and so he just stood there.  

After about twenty seconds, one of the cars began to honk, but James did
not move. He began to feel as though he couldn't move as though he
needed to be there, as though he were now a fixture in the pavement.
Even when there was break in the traffic on the other side of the
street, he just stood there. A few cars tried to dart around him. James
just stood there looking straight ahead. And as he stood there he
started to smile to himself. He smiled at how fragile the whole system
suddenly seemed. He smiled at how one man standing in one lane of a
street could, in only a few minutes, cause cars to back up farther then
he could see.

He also thought about his neighbors watching him. He thought about the
people in the cars watching him. He wondered if anyone he knew could see
him standing there in the street. He wondered what they would think. He
figured they would just think he was crazy. Not a bad assumption he
thought.

A few minutes later he heard a siren. He was certain they were coming to
remove him from the street. He felt some relief that there was now a
definite resolution to his situation, one from which he seemed unable to
extricate himself. He almost smiled as he noticed the difficultly the
police car had getting through the traffic, but thought it best not to
betray any emotion.

The police car stopped near him and the officers both got out. One started
to direct traffic around him and the other came over to ask if he was okay.
He said he was and the officer asked if he would mind moving back to the
side walk. James agreed and walked off the street escorted by the officer.

The officer asked him why he was standing in the street and he said he
didn't know. He said he was tired and confused. Looking toward his house,
he could see his wife and daughter inside. He could see them watching him,
embarrassed to come out.  

The officer did not feel the need to site James for any violation, but
walked him back to his house where his wife Sarah had come out to meet
them on the steps. The officer suggested to Sarah that she take James to
the emergency room so that he could be evaluated. She agreed and they went
back inside.

Sarah was worried. James said that he was just trying to cross the street,
and got stuck halfway, not sure what to do. He said he hadn't very slept
well for the past few nights. It was the kind of explanation that only made
sense if you wanted it to make sense. Sarah looked at him without saying
anything. James said he was fine and headed off to work again, but agreed
to walk down to the intersection and cross at the crosswalk.

That evening when he got home from work he found Sarah in the kitchen
making dinner. His daughter had gone to a friend's house for the night. He
felt relieved by her absence and then guilty. His relationship with his
daughter had become strained over the last year or was it years.  He could
not remember.  He could remember that there was a time when she would run
to hug him as soon as he came in the door. He had heard that the change in
their relationship was just typical adolescent behavior, but he could not
help thinking that it was somehow his fault.

He asked his wife about their plans for the weekend. Not that he cared,
he simply wanted to fill the silence. She said she had talked with her
sister, who was getting divorced and that she might come visit. She had
plans to move back to the city to be near them. The topic provided
enough fodder to carry the conversation through dinner. After dinner he
said he wanted to go for a bike ride. She let him go. She had been more
than accommodating over the past year as he tried to find his way back
to a normal life.  Though he wondered how long this would last.

It was early summer and the days were long. He walked his bike to the end
of the driveway and instead of trying to cross the traffic, he set off in
its flow. He had only recently taken up riding a bike again. The last time
he owned a bike was in college. He still felt nervous riding in the street,
he was either too close to the cars in the street or too close to the cars
parked on the side of the road and never exactly sure where he belonged. 

As he headed into the city the buildings grew larger and closer together
and seemed to press in around him. There were more vehicles and more
lanes of traffic with arrows pointing right and left which only seemed
to add to his uncertainty. At a particularly complicated intersection,
James simply pulled his bike off the road.

He looked at his watch. It was past 9 O'clock.  He decided it was time
to head home. On the other side of the intersection he headed back into
the street with the intention of turning left at the next intersection.
From behind he began to hear people shouting, whooping and ringing
bells. The noise was quickly closing in on him.

Suddenly there were bicycles all around him. The riders looked young and
tough and sounded harsh and loud. They wore clothes of denim and leather
and studs of metal. A few of them smiled at him as if inviting him to
join their fun, but most just ignored him. They were focused the on the
world around them, making sure the world knew they where there. Making
sure the world knew they existed.

James continued to ride within the group where he now felt safe and
powerful. He no longer wanted to head home. 

Approaching a traffic light, the group stopped. James stopped with them.
Some of the riders stood over their bikes, but others continued to ride
around in circles, propelled by a nervous energy. As they waited for the
light to change, the car directly behind them honked its horn and the
group answered with shouts and bells and jeers. The car honked again and
again the group responded with more noise. The light was still red.  The
group began to focus its attention on the car answering each honk with
increased attention. Finally, the driver leaned out of his window and
yelled, "Get the hell out of the road."

As the light turned green, most of the group moved on but five of the bikes
that had been circling continued to circle in front of the car. James
stayed with them standing over his bike in the lane and in front of the car
and looked ahead. This time he was not alone. The car gunned its engine and
honked and then it pushed forward into one of bikes knocking the rider off.
The rider quickly jumped up, picked up his bike and threw it at the front
window of the car cracking the windshield. He and a second rider were
quickly at the drivers side of the car. One of them reached in and opened
the door and grabbed the driver.

The other bikers continued to ride in circles around the entire scene which
now included the car, their two friends, James and the driver. James just
stood over his bike but was now looking back at what was happening.

The two men pulled the driver from his seat. A woman who had been sitting
beside him screamed. Once out of the car, they were shouting at driver and
pushing him back and forth between them. They stopped him as he tried to
run. Then one grabbed him from behind while the and the other punched him
in the chest and in the face. James watched.

Just then they began to hear the wail of a siren in the distance. One of
the bikers said, "Come on Jason, lets go." Another said, "Jay, lets get out
of here." The man holding the driver dropped him on the pavement near the
car and got on his bike. The other man whose bike had been damaged by the
car walked over to James looked at him for a moment and then pushed him
hard to the ground, picked up James's bike and rode off with the other
four.

When James stood up a woman was yelling at him. The driver of the car
was lying on the ground and not moving. The woman from the car was next
to the man on the ground and crying. A young man was consoling the woman
from the car, another man and woman were attending to the driver, an
older man was trying to keep back the crowd that had formed. Each person
playing an important role in the dramatic scene that unfolded around
him, as if actors, walked hidden among pedestrians always ready for
their part in any scene.

James turned to leave. The woman continued to shout at him but remained
where she stood, seemingly unwilling to leave her place on the stage. The
crowd hesitantly made way for his exit, uncertain of their own role in
the performance.

He was a long way from home but he was in no rush to get there. The day
had accumulated more than its usual share of notable events that needed
time to be sorted and filed among the layers of daily debris that made
up his conscious and unconscious self.

As he made his way down the street, the scene of the accident slowly
faded behind him and into the general wash of the city. He became aware
of a throbbing in his hand from where he had landed on it when he fell.
He looked at his hand. Newly dried blood covered the scraped skin. He
noticed that his shirt sleeve was torn and there was bike grease on his
pants. All of which would raise questions in the light of day, but
cloaked in the night he would remain inconspicuous.

His attention was drawn to the scenes that played out around him in the
late hours of night. Two boys and a girl walked in his direction, young
and drunk, a lazy knot of arms that swayed and laughed as they made
their way past. A man argued with a bouncer in front of a night club
while a line of people behind him, anxious and bored, waited their turn.
Across the street, a group of boys hoped, danced and spun down the
sidewalk with aimless bravado.  A car with girls inside drove by. The
boys shouted for their attention. Between them a bottle was tossed and
broke in the street, but from which party, James could not tell.  James
wondered what he shared with these people more than species.

As James neared his home, hungry and reluctant to let the day end, he
decided to stop at a sandwich shop and get a slice of pizza. Inside a
young couple sat at a booth next to the window. The boy ate a bowl of
spaghetti and meatballs in a watery tomato sauce and the girl watched a
television set behind his head. In another booth an older man had fallen
asleep, but bothering no one, he was left alone. 

Two men in aprons worked behind the counter. Olive complexion, dark
hair, short in stature with forearms thick from generations of use.  One
called to the other in a language the James did not understand.  James
assumed they were brothers and that they were from Italy or Greece. The
girl pointed to something on the television. The boy turned to look,
nodded and then went back to his bowl of spaghetti. James placed his
order. The man handed him his change. James wanted to say something
more. He wanted to ask him a question about where he was from or maybe
how long he had worked there.  He had been to the shop many times before
during the day and had seen other customers chat informally with the men
behind the counter. But all James could do was take his change and say
"Thank you."

It was close to 2am when he finally turned onto his street. As he
approached his house he stopped suddenly and then started to run. There
was a police car his the driveway. But when he got to his driveway he
stopped again. The police car was quiet and empty indicating no sense of
emergency. He was not anxious to spend any more time with the police
today.

He could see the lights of his first floor were on. His mind raced
through what sort of event could have brought them to his house.  There
had been burglaries in the neighborhood. Maybe his house had been
robbed.  Then the image of the man lying motionless in the street came
back into his head. Was it possible that the man was dead?  This was
something he had not considered. Could the police be looking for him?
Could they have found him? This did not seem possible. And yet a police
car sat in his driveway in the middle of the night.

He was now close enough to his house to see inside. Under the bright
artificial light of his living room, he could see his wife with her back
to him talking to two police officers. The police officers seemed to be
getting information from his wife, but about what, James thought.
Whatever they were there for he would find out about it later. 

James saw the police officers make their way to the door. James looked
for a place to hide, but seeing none, he made his way quickly down the
driveway and out onto the sidewalk where he started walking away from
his house hoping that he could make it to the side street before they
noticed him.

Waiting on the side street, he heard the police car drive off. Instead
of going home, James decided to keep walking. He walked through his
neighborhood for half hour hoping that when he got home his wife would
be asleep. He quietly made his way up to their bedroom. His wife lay
quietly under the covers. She mumbled a word that he could not make out.
She sometimes talked in her sleep, but it mostly sounded like gibberish
to James.  He slipped into bed next to her. He quickly released himself
to sleep sleep to erasing the long and confusing day.

At exactly 7:30, their alarm clock began its steady chime but was unable
to rouse either James or Sarah for a good five minutes. Finally Sarah,
usually a light sleeper, pulled herself out of slumber.  Seeing James
lying next to her, she began to rock him awake saying "James, it is
7:35" and then, as he sat up and looked at her trying to focus, she
asked him, "What happened to you last night?  When did you get home?"
James explained about the bike accident and that he had walked home. As
he told his story, she examined his wounded hand. Holding it, he watched
as she gently traced the outline of his scraped skin. 

She then looked up at him and asked "Are you alright?" "Yes, I am fine."
he lied. "Why didn't you call me? Don't you think I worry?" she asked.
He responded that by the time he thought to call she would have been
asleep, an excuse which neither he nor she believed. `	

"I called the police." she said. "Oh" he said. "I didn't know what else
to do." she said looking at him and shaking her head. James did not
respond. "Why are you doing this?" she asked in a new and serious tone,
one that would not be shrugged off or ignored. He was not surprised and
only wondered why it had taken her so long.  "Doing what?" he said.
"Don't you know that I feel everything you feel, that I also think about
him every day and that every time I think about him my heart aches with
a pain so deep that I don't know how I will survive it." She paused
looking at him. "Are you going to go on like this forever?" "I don't
want to." He said but was not even sure if that was true.  "Because I
can't take it anymore." she said quietly looking down at the floor and
shaking her head.

For a moment they were both quiet. She looked at his hand again, she had
not stopped holding it. "Does it hurt?" "A little" he said, relieved to
be asked a question that he could answer honestly.

On his way to work that morning, he sat on the bus thinking about what
his wife had said. Maybe he would not go on like this forever, he
thought hopefully, maybe today would be different. Though he could think
of no evidence to support this prediction. He noticed the pain in his
hand and the still fresh memory of the events of yesterday flooded back
into his head.  

He made it to work on time. That was one thing you could say for him he
thought as he sat down at his desk at 9am. He was never late for work.
He looked at the stack of folders that were waiting for him. Each folder
contained an insurance claim that he needed to review. Each claim a
complaint about some minor tragedy and a demand for monetary
compensation. Tragedies that were perpetrated by acts of God or
criminals and directed at the sorts of objects that could be repaired,
rebuilt or replaced, but never made the same. That was how the world
worked, he thought. Nothing ever returned to its original state.  

His job was to find the flaw in the applicant's story, evidence that
their loss was not as tragic or worthy as claimed. When he first started
working at the company, he had been good at his job.

Toward the middle of the afternoon, he got a call from a secretary
requesting that he meet with Denise, the division supervisor at the end
of the day.  She was his boss's boss. He had only met with her a few
times before. Once when he was first hired.

As he entered her office, she was just finishing a phone call. She
pointed to a seat in front of her desk. After putting down the phone,
she asked him how he was doing. She said she understood that it had been
a very difficult year for him. She looked at him with that same sort of
smile that he had seen on so many other faces as if she were trying to
feel his sadness. It seemed to him an odd human instinct that was both
impossible and pointless.

She lowered her glasses and opened a file on her desk and began to
review his job performance over the past year. She reviewed the numbers
of claims he had processed over various periods of time. Apparently for
one six-week period, he had done absolutely nothing. And then it dawned
on him what was happening. As she continued, he began to have a hard
time focusing on what she was saying. He could hear himself
acknowledging her speech at appropriate intervals, but to what he was
confessing he was not sure.

Although her point was already well made, she seemed compelled to
thoroughly explain the details of how she came to her decision. But to
what end?  James thought. He began to feel as though he was no longer
seated in his chair but a few feet up in the air, looking down at her,
as if he had pulled himself up to a safer vantage point.  She did not
seem to notice.  All he wanted was for the conversation to be over.  He
wanted her to stop. If he had had a white flag he would have waved it.
Finally he heard her say, "I'm sorry." which seemed to indicate that she
was finished. He said "Thank you" and left. 

At his desk, he sat and stared at the stack of unprocessed claims. He
felt the urge to push them off his desk and into the trashcan, but he
knew they were not the problem. They were the symptom, evidence of a
breakdown in the system. He was the problem. He needed to be replaced.
How had it gotten this far, he wondered.

He picked up a photo of his family that he kept in the top drawer of his
desk and put it in his shirt pocket. He looked around, not sure what
else to take. There was nothing else that was his. 

A few minutes later a security guard who had been standing across the
room came over to him and asked him for his identity badge.  The guard
called him "sir." He knew the guard's name. "Donald" was printed above
the pocket on his uniform, but in all the years at the company James had
never addressed him directly or exchanged more than a simple greeting.
Now did not seem like the time to start.

The guard stood quietly by his desk while James prolonged the
inevitable, looking through his draws and files as if he might find
something of personal value that needed to take with him. Finally giving
up, Donald escorted him out of the building and before closing the door
behind him said, "Have an nice evening, sir." 


James stood outside the building squinting into the low sun that peaked
out under dark clouds moving in from the West. Across the street a
familiar woman was laughing. James turned to watch her.  She was
laughing in a way that carried her body forward and then back as she
tried to maintain balance rocking from one foot to the other. "What
could she be laughing at?" James thought. Maybe she was laughing at him.
Maybe she knew that he had lost his job. Maybe she was, in fact, a
siren, who had for the past year patiently drawn his attention from his
work until finally he stood outside his office, the door closed and
locked behind him.

With nowhere else to go, James crossed the street. The woman stopped
laughing. It seemed that her joke had run its course. Her objective
realized she would turn her attention to another unsuspecting employee
who had the misfortune to sit at a desk overlooking the plaza. 

He pulled the picture from his shirt pocket. His family was smiling at
him. What had made them smile, he thought?  Was it just because that is
what you did in pictures? His daughter's smile was missing two front
teeth. James remembered writing notes to his daughter for each tooth she
lost. The notes were generally a simple thank you from the tooth fairy
with one two lines about the weather or something equally mundane.  He
would leave them under her pillow in an envelope with two quarters after
she had gone to bed. 

Each morning, after finding a note, she would come down with a big smile
on her face and proudly read the note to James. Then one morning, she
came down without saying anything. When James could wait no longer, he
asked her about the note. All she said was, "Oh Dad, you know the Tooth
Fairy is not real." James paused taken aback and then asked, "Who told
you the Tooth Fairy was not real?" He immediately knew it was the wrong
tack. He should have taken a stance that was more confident. After the
incident he imagined scenarios in which he was able to regain her
confidence and keep the charade going just a little longer. But life did
not offer rehearsals or second chances. They had not given her Santa
Claus or any other typical childhood fictional character. All he wanted
was for her to believe in something that was not real, just for a little
while longer.

He could not return. He had lost his only remaining value to the family.
He quietly cried tears of self pity. Regaining his composure, he pulled
his wallet from his hip pocket. He placed the photo in the wallet.
He had heard that a wallet found in the mail would be returned to its
owner. He walked to the corner of the plaza and tossed the wallet in a
mailbox. It wasn't much but it was all he had to give.

His mind drifted over his family and the world he was leaving. It was
caught in a endless loop. Until he finally pushed it all away. The
people on the plaza again gained his attention.

He walked back to his bench and sat and watched. Sitting on a stone
bench, he watched. Most of the group was scattered around the plaza in
twos and threes. The remainder flitted about between these groups
pausing for conference as if to mimic a larger and more complex social
structure.

He wondered where they all went at night. Maybe, he thought, when
darkness fell complete, they just slowly came to a halt, like windup
creatures whose springs had finally exhausted enough energy that they
could no longer overcome the friction of their gears, and stood resting
motionless until their caretaker came round before dawn to wind them
back up again. 

It began to rain, a light but steady rain. Unprepared their world
quickly dissolved as they left their posts and gathered together in the
middle of the plaza. After a brief conference the majority headed off
together downtown. James followed.

They made a cumbersome group moving down the sidewalk. Sometimes three
and four abreast, sometimes spilling into the street. Every couple of
blocks the group would stop to adjust itself, like an old man stopping
to hike up his sagging trousers.

After about dozen blocks, they stopped and joined a line of people
waiting to enter a large rectangular building. The building, efficiently
constructed from concrete and steel, sat among a mix of buildings,
mostly from and earlier era, built when the hand of a craftsman still
held value. James wondered what misfortune had befallen the building
that previously occupied this space.

The rain remained light, but the crowd was anxious to enter the building
before it got worse. James asked the woman in front of him if she knew
when the building opened. The woman turned to face James. Close up she
looked older than she had seemed from afar. Her face tan and course from
a life spent outside. Her eyes hung tranquil in their sockets as if
waiting for something to arouse them from their slumber. As James looked
at her face, he tried to imagine her as a new born baby. Everyone was a
new born baby once, he thought.

She said it opened at 7pm and added, "but ya'd think the bastards would
open up a little early with the rain." James agreed. 

At exactly 7pm the doors opened and people began to file in. By then the
line behind James extended to the end of the block. Inside, the lobby
was crowded, bright and humid. It smelled of warm bodies and wet
clothes. On the walls were inspirational posters including one that
showed a man on top of a mountain above the phrase "Make it Happen."

The crowd divided into two groups with men going in one door and women
going in the other. A much smaller line formed in front of third door
under a sign that said "New Guest Intake." A staff person had already
identified James as a new guest and directed him to this line where he
waited with the other new guests.

He instinctively felt in his pocket and not finding his wallet,
momentarily panicked before he remembered what he had done with it. He
wondered if some form of ID would be required to stay in the shelter. He
knew that he would at least need a name. The name "Jacob" was the first
that popped into his head. It seemed suitable. "Jacob Jackson" he
thought "or JJ for short. He was surprised how easy it was to come up
with a new name, as if it had been waiting for him. As he stood in line,
he rehearsed introducing himself with his new name.

Inside a private room, James sat across from the councilor. The
councilor asked him for some identification. James said that he did not
have any, adding that he had lost his wallet. The councilor paused
looking up from the form he was completing. He looked at James
suspiciously over his glasses, "Well it is not a requirement for a bed
in the shelter but it is helpful." but did not explain why.  "First and
last name?" "Jacob, Jacob Jackson, my friends call me JJ." James
responded. It sounded awkward when he finally said it out loud, James
thought maybe he had practiced too much. The councilor continued "Date
of birth?" "Last permanent address?" "Are you taking any medication?"
"Are you presently employed?" "Are you married?" "Are you receiving any
treatment for drug addiction?" James answered the questions with a mix
of truth and fiction. "Who should we contact in case of a medical
emergency?" James paused. "No one." The councilor looked up from the
form. "No brothers, no sisters, an aunt, a cousin?" "No." said James.

The councilor gave James two small slips of paper with numbers on them.
One was for his bed assignment and the other for fresh clothing. James
reentered the lobby which had mostly emptied out. A few people, clearly
intoxicated where being directed out of the shelter. A staff member
directed him toward the door to the men's unit. 

On the door to the men's unit were posted instructions that read, "Men
Only" and "No one under 18 allowed." Inside he found himself in a short
hallway where more instructions were posted.  The first in large red
letters read, "All residents must take a shower before entering the
dormitory" with arrows leading to the line for the shower.

Waiting in line, James was handed a towel, soap and a toothbrush. The
showers were along one wall of an open stall and were overseen by
shelter staff. Five men stood naked lathering their bodies with soap.
James could not remember ever seeing a grown man naked before. They
looked comical. Devoid of clothing their bodies seemed lopsided and
limp, generations of Darwinian permutations tempered by little more than
whimsy. Watching them James undressed slowly, hesitant to expose his own
body to judgement.

weak and unbalanced, generations removed from the demands of the feral plain.

After drying off and wearing only a towel, James was directed to an
adjacent coat room where he could get fresh clothes. Standing in line he
heard a voice behind him, "First time here?" James turned to see a
slightly built older man about half a foot shorter than himself. "Yes"
said James uncertain whether he wanted to foster this man's association.
"You should easily get your size." he said "Me, everything they have is
too big.  White shirts are the easiest to fit, but they get dirty right
away and then your stuck. Don't be too picky, but make sure you get the
size you want." "Thanks for the advice" said James not sure there was
much real advice in what the man said. "Anytime." he said offering his hand,
"My name's Isaac." "I'm Jacob" said James or "JJ" he added less
awkwardly than before.

Self consciously James followed Isaac's advice giving his size and
asking for a dark shirt. He tried the new clothes on in another open
room, again under the supervision of shelter staff. The pant legs and
shirt sleeves were a bit long, but he would just keep both rolled up. He
was too shy to ask for another size.

Leaving the coat room, he found the door to the dormitory. Before
entering, he scanned a posting labeled "Resident Rules and
Responsibilities" which included 23 items including everything from
number 5."Residents are limited to two large or three small bags of
belongings." to number 16. "No public display of affection will be
tolerated" It concluded with "Violation of any rule may result in
disciplinary action and the dismissal from the shelter."

The dormitory was one large room that seemed to take up most of one
floor of the building and was almost entirely filled with cots neatly
organized in large rectangle of rows and columns.

Just inside the door, he heard Isaac who had come in behind him.  "Hey
JJ, follow me. I'll show you were to get a bed sheet and blanket." When
James and Isaac had their bedding, Isaac asked to see James's bed
assignment. "36" he said, "that's over by the coke machine a few rows
in." he pointed. "I'll show you." "That's okay" said James. "I am sure I
can find it myself."

James quickly figured out the pattern of numbers which ran down one
column and then up the next column. Finding his assigned cot, he sat
down and took a moment to take in his surroundings. Many, like him, were
just arriving and getting themselves settled in, though in the cot next
to his, less than two-feet away, a man was lying asleep fully clothed.

James spied the men from the plaza. They were assembled in one corner of
the room. Even in the shelter they stood out. Apparently they had
already found a topic of contention and were discussing it with much
excitement. He thought of the item under "Resident Rules and
Responsibilities" which specifically prohibited, fighting, arguing and
petty bickering. 

A few minutes later Isaac was sitting next to him on his cot. He tried
to recall if he had read any rules that prohibited sitting on other
people's cots. Isaac started in on a story about how someone had stolen
his radio last week. At first, the story seemed simple enough but as the
cast of characters in the story grew, James had a hard time following the
plot and began to wonder if it really did even involve a stolen radio.

As Isaac spoke, James watched Isaac's hands which mostly sat quietly in
his lap flying up periodically to emphasize an important point.  His
skin was dry and rough, evidence a life unprotected from the elements.
On his hands, there were rough bumps, remnants of cuts that had been
left to heal untended as well as a few cuts still healing.  James's own
hands were smooth. The few scares no more than small white lines.  

After Isaac finished his story he, offered to give James a tour of the
dormitory. With two hours left until lights out, and no other obvious
options for passing the time, James agreed. Although there was not much
to tour in the one large room, Isaac proved an entertaining guide
relating anecdotes such as the night that Big Al was snoring so loudly
they picked up his cot and moved him into the bathroom without him
ever waking up.

At 6am the lights came on to a chorus of groans and a couple of angry
shouts. The man who had been sleeping next to James when he arrived
remained asleep. Everyone had to be out by 7am so there was a lot of
shuffling around. As James his sheet and blanket, he thought of the
adage, early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.

It was not until James had spilled out onto the street along with the
other guests that he realized that he had not eaten breakfast. He was
feeling pretty hungry since his only dinner had been a couple of peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches at the shelter. He looked for Isaac, the one
friendly face he know but could not find him. He asked the man who has
just come out of the door behind him, where to get breakfast. The man
suggested Rachel's Kitchen which provided a hot breakfast seven mornings
a week and that James could follow him there. A few of the other guests
seemed to be headed in the same directions. James wondered where the
others were going. 

The man's name was Miguel and had come here from Mexico to work in
construction, but with the recent downturn in the economy had been out
of work for a few months. He talked with James about his family back in
Mexico and that he was considering returning.

Leaving the kitchen James stood on the sidewalk. The morning sun still
low in the sky cast long shadows down the street. For the first time in
his memory, he felt that he had nowhere to be. He just stood there while
the other patrons filed out around him and headed heading up or down the
street. The sun felt warm against his face.

He thought about his day. There was lunch, dinner and the shelter. He
pulled a of slip of paper from his pocket that he had gotten from the
woman checking people in at the kitchen. It listed the address and hours
for meals held around the city.  His only real concern was making sure
that he was in line at the shelter by 6:15pm to make sure he got a bed
for the evening.

James turned toward the center of the city and started walking. He
passed kids on their way to school. He passed a man walking his dog. He
passed vendors opening their shops and early risers entering shops while
the vendors were still raising their awnings. His thoughts wandered no
further than to what was at the end of the block or around the next
corner. 

As the days wore on, his mind, no longer amused simply by the recent
change in venue, searched for different forms of distraction. Hours were
spent replaying memories mostly from his youth, a baseball game, a
birthday party, scenes from summer camp, and to no apparent purpose,
being impossible to alter and providing no useful insights into his
present state. 

It was more than a week, before memories of his son began creeping back
into his consciousness. But unlike before where they provided an easy
place to wallow, they now pulled him into their depths, disengaged from
his role as husband and father, a role which no matter how poorly he
performed still provided a healthy bulwark against the raw emotions of
life that would now leave him crying in the middle of the day on a
public bench. 

He took to crafting distractions, hobbies as he thought of them, to
carry him through his days. One was counting steps in the city. Steps
that led up to churches and the city hall or down into public parks. He
had by now acquired a few belongings including a notebook and two pens
in which he could track of things. First Presbyterian Church: 28 steps
up from Hastings St. 

And then one day it rained. It was the first time it had rained since he
had come to the shelter. The rain started falling on his way to the
Rachel's Kitchen.

He wandered through a constant stream of people on their way to work, to
lunch, to shop, everyone with a real destination and real purpose.  Each
person meeting a near-term need on the path toward some greater goal,
and together endlessly and blindly constructing the world he saw around
him.

He
walked to the St. Anselms garden. He walked to the Linden St. bridge. He
walked to the end of the 32st pier. All destination chosen at random,
but destinations nonetheless. Each time he arrived he would stop and
look, but only for a few seconds and then move on.


he day went by in a blur. He was tired most of the morning and finally
fell asleep on a park bench after lunch.

He had been
tired all morning, as if his body was trying to make up for years of
sleep deprivation. He made sure to remain sitting up while he slept. 

Each day he tried different plans. One day he listened to baseball game.
He craved what he could not have. He did not think about his son or
family. Unlike work where he had something to do, but did not do it.
Here he had nothing to do but wanted to do something.
 

James's life quickly fell into a routine of sleeping at the shelter,
getting breakfast at Rachel's Kitchen and dinner at Our Lady of Sorrows
Parish. During the middle of the day he mostly stayed hungry envying
those who sat in the cafes he passed.
 

As he walked, he fell into his own thoughts, thoughts of his family, of
his wife, of the mistakes he had made. Often these thoughts would form a
circular pattern 

After few days of wandering, he decided to set arbitrary goals for
himself. He would cross every bridge in the city but each bridge only
once between breakfast and diner. 

This could not keep his full attention, he began to look for things in
his path. His first big find was a small spiral notebook with most of
the pages unused which he placed in his pocket. This was useful for
writing down ideas he had as he was walking. He had gotten a pen at the
shelter, but had only had bits of scrap paper for writing notes.

He found a rubber band
to hold the pen with the notebook. Rubber bands were easy finds. He
could find close to fifty cents in coins on a good day.

In the evening in the
shelter, he would take out his daily finds which including a growing
number of rubber bands which he kept in a ball, almost a dollars worth
of change, two sticks of gum, a baby's mitten. He found that the more he
looked the better he got at seeing what others had dropped. 

As he gathered more things he kept them in a cheap reusable shopping
that he had found, but he was on the lookout for something he could
carry on his back and close. The bag was hard to carry did not feel
secure from theft or prying eyes. 


gets food. Finds things and keeps them. Gets a bad. Find routines.
Returns cans to get money. Grows a beard. 

HE BUILDS UP HABITS AND STUFF. HE WRITES IN A NOTEBOOK.

As James sat in his usual chair looking out over the sidewalk he noticed
a man and a woman walking down the sidewalk. The man was pushing a bike.
He was the man from the accident. He was the one who had pulled the
driver from the car and the one who had taken his bike. With no specific
plan, James quickly gathered his materials, placed them in his backpack
and left the library to follow the couple.

He had no trouble keeping up with them as they seemed to be in no rush
to reach their destination. They finally stopped at a small house that
sat comfortably among other equally small houses each in need of some
minor repair from a pealing paint to broken. Many with the hallmark of
student residents, bikes.

James stopped and watch them enter the house bringing the bike inside.
He felt self conscious standing on the street watching the house. 

James knocked on the door. After less than a minute a woman answered.
She opened the door just wide enough for her body to fill the gap. He
recognized her from the accident as well. She had been with the group
circling on bikes while the two men punched the driver. She did not seem
to recognize him. "Can I help you?" she asked in tone that indicated she
had no interest in helping him. "I was at the accident." he said. "What
accident?" "The one where your friend beat up the driver" She said
nothing and just looked at him her expression unchanged. "The driver who
hit your friends bike." "I was in front of the car as well.  Your friend
took my bike."

Her eyes narrowed slightly as she looked at him more carefully and then
said "Hold on" and closed the door. He could here people talking behind
the door. She opened the door again. She asked him "What do you want?"
He said, he wanted to come in. She said, "Sorry, I think you must have
the wrong house." and closed the door. 

James stood there, for a moment wondering if he could have been
mistaken. He knocked on the door again. There was a pause and then the
same woman answered the door and said, "You need to go away." James did
not move. The door opened wider and the man now stood beside her. He
said, "If you don't go away we will have you arrested for trespassing."
James said, "I want to come in." The man exasperated said, "What are you
doing here?  You think you saw some people beat up some guy a few weeks
ago and you think someone here looks like one of those people, but you
are mistaken so you need to go away." 

"I don't have anywhere else to go" said James. "What do you mean?" asked
the man. "I live in a shelter." "You live in a shelter." the man
repeated as if he was not sure he believed a word of what James was
saying. There was a pause and then James said, "I saw what happened."
"And what is that supposed to mean?" the man asked.

The door then shut again. James stood there for what seemed like five
minutes. The woman opened the door again and stood there. After a few
seconds she said, "Well, what are you waiting for?" As James entered the
man smiled and said, "One of us is definitely going to regret this and I
think it's going to be you." The woman said, "Don't mind Jay, he can be
a little dramatic." "Well, it's not like we need another mouth to feed."
"Don't worry, he doesn't look like he eats too much" said another man
standing in the entry to the kitchen, whom James recognized as the
person who had held the driver while Jay hit him.

"We are just making dinner. I assume you are in no rush?" the woman
said. "No" said James. "Well have a seat, it will be ready in about 20
minutes." The three went back to preparing dinner while James sat on the
couch quietly looking through a few books that were on the coffee table.

When diner was ready, they called James to the table which was set for
five. After everyone was served, one of the men said, "So tell us, why
they hell you are here." James told them his story from losing his son
to losing his job. He left nothing out with the exception of not
mentioning his daughter. They asked him lots of questions and he
answered them honestly. About fifteen minutes into the meal, a woman
entered the house.

After they seemed to have finished asking question. The man said,
"So you want to stay with us?" "Yes." said James. "And you know nothing
about us, except that you claim that you saw one of us beat up a
driver?" James nodded. The man looked at his friends and then turned
back to James. "Okay get out." said the man. James looked confused. "Go
out on the porch and wait, we need to talk about this."

James went out on the porch. Inside Jay spoke first. "This guy is a
lunatic" "Well, he'll be in good company" said Nick. "I don't understand
why are we even considering this?" said Jay. "Because he has threatened
to go to the police." said Erica. "We don't need that." said Nick.
Everyone was quiet for a moment.

We haven't done too well on the recruiting front. It is hard to pull the
masses from their slumber.

"What, is he just going to sit around the house all day and eat our
food?" Jay looked at the group and then answering his question, said,
"If he stays, he rides. And he gets a job." "I'm okay with that." said
Dice. "And he's not sleeping on the couch." added Jay. "He can sleep on
the back porch. We'll find some cushions." said Nick.

Nick smiled at Jay and said "You always said you wanted to build an
army." Jay just shook his head.

Jay opened the door and invited James back in. "In case you don't
already know, I'm Jay." each of the others introduced themselves. Jay
explained that he could sleep on porch. He also said that he would need
to get a job. They would find him a bike actually we still have your
piece of crap.

That night Jay slept on the cold porch. It felt good to be alone.

As James and Jay finished drying the last of the dishes from dinner,
Nick started taking the bikes down from their rack on the wall. Leaving
the kitchen, Dice offered a baseball cap and handkerchief saying, "You
ready to go?" "Go where?" James asked. "Where we going Nick?" "Where
ever the wind takes us." said Nick. Dice pointed to the back porch, "Get
you bike in here so we can check it out." James went to get his bike and
brought it into the living room for Dice to check out. While James
waited he noticed that everyone had tied handkerchiefs around their
necks and were wearing either knit or baseball caps. The wore dark
tee-shirts or jackets and dark pants. 

Each were strapping hammers to their bikes.

As people began bringing their bikes outside, Dice said to James, "Just
stay close and do exactly as we do." Dice checked that James had tied
his handkerchief so that it could fit snugly on his face when he brought
it up. As the stood on the walk in front of you their house, Jay turned
to James, smiled and said, "You think you can keep up with us on that
piece of shit?" referring to James's bike "I guess so" said James
nervous about what was going to happen tonight.	

No lights no reflective clothing.

The five of them took off down the block moving at an easy pace for
James. They headed toward the city with each of the four taking the lead
at various points. The rode in single file and two abreast where
possible. At first they generally seemed to be moving toward the city,
over time, James noticed that they seemed to be meandering, going left
and then. James enjoyed not having to think about where he was going. No
one spoke much. They stopped at lights. It felt like a nice evening
ride. It was getting later and later. There was some chatter when they
stopped to wait for a light. They stayed off busier roads.   

Nearing a crosswalk, Erica who was in lead signaled for the group to
stop as a woman stepped into the crosswalk. Behind James a sport truck
blasted its horn, gunned its engine an drove past intentionally and
dangerously close to Dice who was on the outside of the group. The woman
in the crosswalk, used to exercising caution, stopped well out of harms
way. Before the truck had even past, the group was back on their bikes
and moving.  Dice looked over at James smiled and said, "Its hammer
time." a reference to a popular hip hop song, that James did not
understand. She then pulled up her handkerchief and motioned to James to
do the same. 

The truck speed away with the bicycles in pursuit. Sensing danger, the
truck accelerated. It swerved into oncoming traffic to pass a slow
moving car. The bicycles kept pace, easily slipping through the traffic.
The bicycles were moving fast, impossibly fast it seemed to James who
could not keep up. Approaching a red traffic light, the truck turned
right skidding onto a side street and scraping against a parked car on
the opposite side of the street.

On the small and empty street, Jay stood off his saddle and accelerated
up to the driver's side of the truck. He raised his hammer and smashed
the driver side window. The driver lost control of the truck and for a
second it swerved left. This allowed Dice to move up to the passenger
side of the truck and Nick to move in just behind it. Dice, using her
left arm, swung her ice axe into the front right tire letting it get
wedged under the wheel well. The tire burst.  At the same time, Nick
threw his heavy spear into the truck's rear window.

(The combination of the two wounds)
This combination caused the truck to swerve further to the right hitting
a parked car. It fell forward on its crippled front wheel, and then
flipped completely on its side sliding to a stop in the middle of the
street.

The riders quickly surrounded the vehicle as it lay in the street. Jay
jumped on the side of the truck which was now its top. They raised their
retrieved axes, hammers and spears gave a feral cry of victory. The
driver crawled mostly unharmed through where the front windshield had
fallen out. Slightly dazed, the driver slowly regained his senses.
Confronted by the cyclist wild jeers and cries, he ran from the scene.

They all four then gathered around the front of the truck. James, who
had finally caught up, now joined them barely able to catch his breath.
The truck lay motionless its engine still running and coughing. Jay
opened the hood of the truck to expose the engine. He reached in,
grabbed a fuel line and pulled one end out. Fuel gurgled from the line
wetting Jays hands and spilling on the engine and road and then stopped.
The engine sputtered, gave one last cough and died. 

Jay walked over to James and placed his fuel soaked thumb on James lips.
He pressed his thumb against his lips and then into James's mouth so
that James could taste the acrid and oily fuel. "Distilled the bodies of
the most powerful mammals to walk the Earth." he said. Jay rubbed his
thumb in James's mouth like a mother soothing a teething babies gums.
Jay removed his thumb smiled at James and said, "Welcome." He then
tasted the fuel from his own fingers. Dice, Nick and Erica all reached
in the engine, wetting their own hands then licked the fuel from their
fingers.

In the distance they heard the sound of sirens winding up as firetrucks
began to make their way to the scene of the accident. They each quietly
mounted their bikes and rode home with Jay and Dice taking turns at the
lead.

"Did James ever tell you that he had a daughter?" Erica asked Dice one
afternoon when they were alone. "What?" said Dice. "Yesterday, he
mentioned to me that he had a teenage daughter." "When he first arrived,
Nick asked him if he had any other kids and he distinctly said No."
"Does it really matter that much?" asked Erica. "He lied to us and he is
an asshole." said Dice, whose father had left her family when she was
young adding "I am fine with him leaving his wife. She is an adult, but
not his daughter. We all need to talk. This matters to me, a lot." 

They agreed to meet on Wednesday evening when James would be at work and
Jay could get off early. Dice told what she learned from Erica and said,
"He intentionally lied to us."

That night they had left a chase unable to stop the car. Heading
downhill on a main street they took the middle lane. Dice looked at
James and swung her pick into his thigh. James twisted fell to the
street and on coming lane. James stood watching a car approach. He stood
and did not move. The oncoming car applied its brakes but too late.


Jude earned the money. By day he worked as a programmer and made enough to
support them all. He did not mind doing this. He enjoyed is work for the
most part and could not believe how much money they gave him. Jenna
volunteered in a soup kitchen. Dala worked as a social worker with
students. 

he streets were quiet. He walked in the hours between good and bad, when
the bad had given up and gone to bed and the good were still waiting for
the dawn to start their day.

The library had been built in the 1920s and was one of the majestic
buildings of the city. The large cool open space of the great room retained
its elegance as the city went through transformations from rich to poor and
back again. James just wandered the shelves looking for a book to read.
Choosing a book was always hard. He finally found something to read and
settled into a chair on the second floor of the building near a window. 

With no job and no money, he had not choice about his place in society.
With each niche there were requirements such as age, race and income.
Certain ones were only achieved by income. Some you just fell into by age
or social status. He could no more be a punk or valley girl. Though all of
these required some income, if only for the basic attire that the social
class expected. The status of homeless or transient required no capital of
any kind. In fact, it was the requirement. In that way it was a sort of
exclusive club. You could visit or pretend, but you could not truly belong
if you had capital assets. 

Inside his house, the same officer who had been there in the morning was
saying to his wife that in order to even file a missing person report, her
husband would to have been missing for at least 24 hours. He also reminded
her that she should have taken him to the emergency room as he suggested.
He promised he would keep a look out and would file an official report as
soon as he could.

James was born in a small town in New Hampshire that had slowly made its
way from rural to suburban. He lived with his mother in a house that
belonged to the latter type and of no particular distinction. It resided
within a cluster of houses equally lacking in any sort of character,
houses that weren't designed so much as built. They served their purpose
as basic shelter including places for sleeping, eating and watching
television.

James was raised by his mother father who left the family when he was
two. If he existed at all it was in a sort of hazy, dream-like memory
that could not be distinguished from a photograph.

His thoughts settled on high school where he wondered about friends he
had not seen in years.
