From his office window, James watched as a woman across the street yelled
at a man sitting on a bench. He couldn't hear her yell, but he could see
her raised arms and her clenched fists and he could see her mouth and her
eyes looking down at him as if she might consume him with her rage. The man
looked up and watched her, but did not seem all that concerned. 

The drama across the street was nothing new. James had seen it play out
everyday since he moved into his office four years ago. The cast of
characters varied throughout the year, though there were a few regulars.
Their numbers increased in the summer months and dwindled in the winter. He
had heard that there was a methadone clinic nearby by way of an explanation
for their presence.

They were mostly white, but of assorted shapes, sizes, ages and genders.
They would shout, laugh, gesture, dance, cajole, negotiate, argue, yell and
sometimes even fight, but never to any great effect.  They wore jackets,
pants, sundresses and skirts, and held hand bags and cell phones just like
everyone else, but they were different.

One difference was that their lives were not punctuated by the usual
changes of venue associated with work day, evening and weekend. Their lives
unfolded continuously in this one location each day from morning to night
like actors on a perpetual stage playing for no one but James or so it
seemed to him.  For no one else ever seemed to notice them.  What amazed
James most was that no matter when he looked out the window they seemed to
be engaged in conversations, often of apparently vital importance.  What
could be so important in their lives, lives that seemed to have no external
consequence. What curcial information was being conveyed. What dramatic
conflict was mounting or being resolved. By contrast, James's own life
seemed comparatively dull. Days would go by when he could rarely think of a
single interesting thing to tell his wife. 

As James looked out his window and watched, his thoughts drifted to his
son. For the past year, he had looked out his window and thought about his
son. For the past year, he has also done so little work, that he felt he
should have been fired or, at the very least, moved to a desk without a
window. He could only assume that his manager felt sorry for him and that
when she weighed the emotional cost of firing him against monitary cost of
his lack of productivity, he came out slightly ahead. He wasn't planning to
argue with her on this point.

Someone had once told him that after a year, you either move on or you
don't.  James was not moving on. A year ago, James's son was hit by car and
killed as he was walking home from school. The driver was not drunk or
senile, just careless and young.

That evening as he brushed his teeth, he could hear the traffic outside his
house through the open windows. When he and his wife had moved to this
house ten years ago, the street was mostly quiet. Now there always seemed
to be cars on the street with traffic in mornings and evenings.  Where had
all these cars come from he wondered and where were they all going?

James hated cars. He hated their noise. He hated their size. He hated how
they lined every street of his city. He hated how they had become the most
dominate feature of the urban landscape. But mostly he hated them because
of what they had done to Tim. 

The next morning, he stood waiting to cross his street to catch the bus to
work.  It seemed to take even longer than usual to find a break in the
traffic. First there was traffic on one side of the street and then on the
other. When the street was finally clear on both sides he started across,
but just then a car came out from a side street and was now moving in his
direction. Instead of walking back to the sidewalk, he just stopped where
he was in the street and waited for the car to pass in front of him.  But
this car was followed by another and now there was now a car coming toward
him in the lane where he was standing. He didn't move. He just stood there
and waited.  The car coming toward him stopped and within a short time more
cars backed up behind it.  Since there were still cars traveling on the
opposite side of the street, he just stood there.  

After about twenty seconds, one of the cars began to honk, but James did
not move. He began to feel as though he couldn't move as though he needed
to be there, as though he were now a fixture in the pavement.  Even when
there was break in the traffic on the other side of the street, he just
stood there. A few cars tried to dart around him when it was clear. James
just stood there looking straight ahead. And as he stood there he started
to smile to himself. He smiled at how fragile the whole system suddenly
seemed. He smiled at how one man standing in one lane of a street could, in
only a few minutes, cause cars to back up farther then he could see.

He also thought about his neighbors watching him. He thought about the people
in the cars watching him. He wondered if anyone he knew could see him standing
there in the street. He wondered what they would think. He figured they would
just think he was crazy. Not a bad assumption he thought.

A few minutes later he heard a siren. He was certain they were coming to
remove him from the street. He felt some relief that there was now a
definite resolution to his situation, one from which he seemed unable to
extricate himself. He almost smiled as he noticed the difficultly the
police car had getting through the traffic, but thought it best not to
betray any emotion.

The police car stopped near him and the officers both got out. One started to
direct traffic around him and the other came over to ask if he was okay. He
said he was and the officer asked if he would mind moving back to the side
walk. James agreed and walked off the street escorted by the officer.

The officer asked him why he was standing in the street and he said he
didn't know. He said he was tired and confused. Looking toward his house,
he could see his wife and daughter inside. He could see them watching him,
embarrassed to come out.  

The officer did not feel the need to site James for any violation, but
walked him back to his house where his wife Brenda finally came out to meet
them on the steps. The officer suggested to Brenda that she take James to
the emergency room so that he could be evaluated. She agreed and they went
back inside.

Brenda was worried. James said that he was just trying to cross the street,
and got stuck halfway, not sure what to do. He said he hadn't very slept
well for the past few nights. It was the kind of explanation that only made
sense if you wanted it to make sense. Brenda looked at him without saying
anything. James said he was fine and headed off to work again, but agreed
to walk down to the intersection and cross at the crosswalk.

That evening when he got home from work the house felt even quieter than
usual.  Brenda was in the kitchen making dinner. His daughter had gone to a
friend's house for the night. His relationship with his daughter had become
strained over the last year or was it years.  He could not remember. He
could remember that there was a time when she would run to hug him as soon
as he came in the door. He had heard that the change in their relationship
was just typical adolescent behavior, but he could not help thinking that
it was somehow his fault.

He talked with his wife about his day, but not about the morning. She had
some news about her sister's divorce and her plans to move back to the city
to be near them. After dinner he said he wanted to go for a bike ride. She
let him go. She had been more than accommodating over the past year as he
tried to find his way back to a normal life. Though he wondered how long
this would last.

It was the beginning of summer and the days were long. He walked his bike
to the end of the driveway and instead of trying to cross the traffic, he
set off in its flow. He had only recently taken up riding a bike again. The
last time he owned a bike was in college. He still felt nervous and
awkward.  He tried to stay close to side of the street, but was constantly
nervous about someone opening a car door in his path. He rode slowly and
carefully and followed the newly painted bike lanes farther into the city. 

As he heading into the city the buildings grew closer together and became
larger.  There was more traffic. He was now surrounded by more cars, trucks
and buses and the traffic patterns became more complicated with different
lanes for turning and going straight. He tried figure out where he fit
within complicated rules that were designed primarily for cars.

It was getting late and he was about to start to head back home. Behind him
he began to hear people shouting, whooping and ringing bells. He could tell
they were on bikes because the noise was quickly closing in on him. Then
they were all around him. They were young and tough and harsh and loud.
They wore was denim and leather and metal and tatoos. 

Within their midst, James felt self-conscious, but also safe.  Protected by
an armor of bikes and youth and noise, he no longer worried about cars and
lanes and traffic.  He drifted farther out into the street. A few of them
smiled at him as if inviting him to join their fun, but most ignored him.
They were focused the on the world around them, making sure the world new
they were there.  They wanted to be seen. They wanted to be heard. 

The group came to a traffic light and stopped. James stopped with them.
Some stood over their bikes, but others continued to ride around in circles
seemingly unable to suppress their nervous energy. As they waited for the
light to change, the car directly behind them honked its horn once and then
when they did not move honked again. The light was still red. The group
began to focus its attention on the car. Answering each honk with shouts
and yells and bike bells. Finally, the driver leaned out of his window and
yelled, "Get the hell out of the road."

As the light turned green, most of the group moved on but the five bikes
that had been circling continued to circle in front of the car. James
stayed with them standing over his bike in the lane and in front of the car
and looked ahead. This time he was not alone. The car gunned its engine and
honked and then pushed forward into one of bikes knocking the rider off and
damaging his bike. The rider quickly jumped up, picked up his bike and
threw it at the front window of the car cracking the windshield. He and a
second rider were quickly at the drivers side of the car. One of them
reached in and opened the door and grabbed the driver.

The other bikers continued to ride but now in circles around the scene
which included the car, their two friends, James and the driver. James just
stood over his bike but was now looking back at what was happening.

The two men pulled the driver from his seat. A woman who had been sitting
beside him screamed. Once out of the car, they were shouting at driver and
pushing him back and forth between them. They stopped him as he tried to
run. Then one grabbed him from behind while the and the other punched him
in the chest and in the face. The sound was nothing like James had ever
heard before. 

Just then they began to hear the wail of a siren in the distance. One of
the bikers said, "Come on Jason, lets go." Another said, "Jay, lets get out
of here." The man holding the driver dropped him on the pavement near the
car and got on his bike. The other man whose bike had been damaged by the
car walked over to James and pushed him to the ground, picked up James's
bike and rode off with the other four.

When James stood up a woman was yelling at him. The driver of the car was
lying on the ground. He was not moving. The woman from the car was next to
him and crying.  People where gathering. James wondered at how all these
people had suddenly appeared, each playing an important role in the scene
of the accident: the woman yelling at him, a young man consoling the woman
from the car, another man and woman attending to the driver, an older man
trying to keep the crowd back. 

James decided that it was time to leave and turned to make his way through
the small crowd in which he now found himself. The woman continued to shout
at him but remained where he had been, seemingly unable to or afraid to
leave her place. The crowd made way for his exit, uncertain if they should
detain him, uncertain about their own role in the unfolding scene. 

James was born in a small town in New Hampshire that was making the long,
and slow from rural to suburban. He lived with his mother in a house that
belonged to the latter camp and of no particular distinction and that was
placed within a clump of houses equally lacking in any sort of character,
houses that weren't designed so much as built. They served their purpose as
basic shelter including places for sleeping, eating and watching television
and offered a strong counter argument to the notion that form follows
function. 

James never knew is father although he did not leave the family until James
was two. If he existed at all it was in a sort of hazy, dream-like memory
of someone he had seen in a photograph an in that foggy brain of a child.

James decided to make his way home on foot. The chaos of the scene he left
slowly faded into the general wash of the city. He was in no hurry to get
home, but was glad to at least have a destination. The night was quiet. His
hand throbbed from where he had scrapped it when he fell. He noticed that
his shirt was torn and there was some bike grease on his pants. But cloaked
in the night these features were both less visible and less unusual.  As he
walked, he thought about the events of his long day. 

After more than an hour he was on his street walking down the sidewalk
toward his house. As he got close, he noticed a police car parked in his
driveway.  The lights in his house were on although it was far past
midnight.  He felt panic. His mind raced back to the scene and the driver.
He could see him lying on the ground not moving. He had not thought much
about the fate of the driver. He had mixed feelings about what had
happened, but he figured that the driver would be alright. Didn't people
who got punched just get up and shake it off. He did not have much
experience with these sorts of things. His head started to swim.

This was not how he saw himself or how he wanted to see himself. So far,
his world had been pretty simple. There good guys and bad guys. He was was
a good guy, at least, not the bad guy. And now someone had died or might
have died and he might somehow be involved. It all started to feel like a
dream. 

How could they have found him so quickly? He would tell them that it was
not his fault. He had done nothing wrong. He did not even know the people
who did it. They would have to believe him. Moving quickly toward the house
he felt he needed to do anything to contain the panic that was wildly
driving his imagination in every direction.

But then as he started walking down his driveway he stopped. Inside the
house under the bright artificial light of his living room, he could see
his wife, his daughter and the policemen. Suddenly what was inside seemed
more dangerous than what was outside. He was overwhelmed by the unknown
consequences of the potential confrontation.  He was overwhelmed by the
thought of getting caught back up in a world from which he would never
again be able to extract himself. The room now seemed to be a source of
danger not relief from it.  His world slowed to a halt. Something was
telling him to back up and move on and so he did.

Inside his house, the same officer who had been there in the morning was
saying to his wife that in order to even file a missing person report, he
would to have been missing for at least 24 hours. He said he had only come
by the house because of the events of the morning, but she would still need
to wait. He promised he would keep a look out and would file an official
report as soon as he could.

James walked back to the street and continued down his sidewalk. He now
felt anxious and the needed to move quickly. He needed to get away. He
needed to find a place where he would not be recognized. He needed to find
a place to sleep.  And once again in the short span of this seemingly
endless day, new directives replaced old ones with equal urgency.

His world was one where people slept in doors. They slept in their rooms
and they slept in their beds. He could not recall ever seeing a person
sleeping outside, but he felt that a park not too far from his house
offered the best option. He was lucky it was warm out. Once in the park, he
followed the path around a small pond. Leaving the path near a small wooded
hill he scouted for a location that would offer the most privacy.

As he walked his mind raced through various options.  His first thought was
to head to an underpass in a neighboring town where he could sleep. He had
heard of people doing this.  Tomorrow he find a GoodWill and buy some
different clothes, ones that would make him look more like a street person,
though it was not clear to him exactly what sort of look this required. He
would then find whatever shelter people used downtown as a place to stay at
night till he made other plans.  

Here was life he thought. Freedom. 

Though he was now on a new course, one in which it was not clear to him how
to obtain basic food and shelter and he would need to transition during
that time one by its very non-conventional natural was not conducive to
staying out of site. It was that people did not sleep outside in the city
it was that he did not look like one of them.

That night he slept in the wooded section of a park. He did not sleep well
and woke up with the sun. He had thought about taking a bus to another city
where no one would know him, but that felt even more terrifying that
staying in his own city. He liked his city. He knew his city. It was the
one remaining sense of the familiar and so he clung to it.

He left the park to find something to eat, though now under the light of
day the small faults in his attire were easier to see and likely to draw
attention. His shirt sleave was torn badly and there was grease on his
pants and he was generally disheveled from sleeping out all night. 

It was odd he thought that same sort of tor

He thoght about the bikers he had seen last night.  One of them with his
hair shaved into a line on his head and painted in recived no more than a
passing glance and yet, his 

He went to a diner not far from his house but one he had never been to
before. He liked that he did not have to go to work. He purchased a paper
and found an article about the incident between the biker and the car
mentioned in the second page of the metro section. And right in the middle
of the article was a sketch of his own face. No name was given, but how
long before they put two and two together. He was certain his wife had
notified the police by now about his absense. So for the moment they only
had a sketch. The article said he was being sought for questioning. He had
always wondered what this meant.

He could easily be accused. Was the man dead? They had no one else and
needed to find he would be one of the gang that killed this man. This was a
serious offense and now he had run. The women at the scene who yelled at
him seemed to be certain he was to blame, but why? What had she seen? She
would accuse him, but who would defend him? Others had seen him and seen
here yelling at him. At first it seemed obvious since he knew he was
innocent. 

What does he do with his wallet.

With no job and no money, he had not choice about his place in society.
With each niche there were requirements such as age, race and income.
Certain ones were only achieved by income. Some you just fell into by age
or social status. He could no more be a punk or valley girl. Though all of
these required some income, if only for the basic attire that the social
class expected. The status of homeless or transient required no capital of
any kind. In fact, it was the requirement. In that way it was a sort of
exclusive club. You could visit or pretend, but you could not truly belong
if you had capital assets. 

This was a status he had acheived. He was not pretending though he was
still a novice or new comer. He looked the part. He was wearing clothing
that he had purchased from Goodwill mostly to disguise himself. He thought
it best if it did not fit perfectly and if it were colorful. He let his
hair grow. 

The next night after he stayed in the park he was waiting in line for
transport to one of the city shelters. He was not sure which shelter he
was going to but he had seen people lining up here for years and knew that
these were where people lined up to go to shelters for the evening. As the
line moved forward people were checked for intoxication. Even here levels
of status remained and he fit in the right crowd.

When he arrived at the shelter he was assigned a cot in the men's room. He
immediately recognized people. Some of the people who he saw outside his
window. Here the formed a group of friends, a clique and did not mingle
much with the others. Just the men. They generally seemed more subdued
here. He was able to get a meal and a shower.      

He did not have a bag for his belongings, because he had no belongings and
this alone set him apart. 

His days continued like this for a while. It seemed so easy to hide in
plain site. He spent his days at the library and nights in the shelter. He
was not well fed, but was not starving either. He was not sure how long it
would last before someone recognized him.

But where was he going. What was the goal of this exercise. He had always
had a purpose or at least a path and direction. But now there seemed to be
no path. He was not moving forward. He had a pattern to his day but there
was no sense of progressing. He felt that he was in a holding pattern
circling in the sky and waiting to land or waiting for what would happen
next. And this made him anxious.
 
He sat in the new section of the library with windows that looked onto the
street. The old section had been built for the purpose of the secure
storage of books and general access. The new portion of the library had
been build as a public space in the model of a cutting edge department
store with three floors of products and glass walls looking out on the
public. 

It was in one of these views that James sat looking out when he noticed
to people walking one pushing a bike. The guy who had held the man from the
car and a girl from the group. He froze thinking they might see him, but
then he realized that he needed to follow them. They were the key to his 

He decided to follow them. These were his people. This was where he
belonged. He did not look or sound like them. He was the wrong age and came
from the wrong background, but it was where he belonged. They walked for
blocks through the city. The walked into an urban neighborhood just outside
the city. They walked father than most people walked. He imagined himself
as a detective, but they did not seem to be suspicious. As he followed them
he imagined meeting them and what he would say.

They reached a a two family home they defintely looked as if it were
rented to students and went inside. James stood on the street near the
house and could not decide what to do. He thought about in college how he
and some friends had walked to party, but then stood outside the house
afraid to go in. He felt self conscious in his new role and was now out
side of his routine not sure how he looked standing on the street.    

Finally, he went up and knocked on the door. After a few minutes a woman
answered. He recognized her from the evening. She was one of the ones who
had smiled at him when they first began riding together. She did not seem
to recognize him and he became again aware of his disguise. "How can I help
you" she said in tone that assumed she was in no way interested in helping
him. "I was at the accident" he said. "What accident?" "The one where the
man hit your friends bike and then was pulled from the car." He did not
want to add and then beaten for it felt too accusatory. Her eyes narrowed
slightly as she recognized him and then a slight smile as she said, "Hold
on" and closed the door. He could here people talking and then she opened
the door again. She asked him "What do you want?" He said, he wanted to
come in.  She said, "Okay" and opened the door to allow him inside. 

When he came in the guy who had lost his bike at the accident was standing
there. He said, "So your the guy whose bike I stole. It was a total piece
of crap." James, just said "sorry" but then realized that he did not
exactly owe him and apology. "No problem" he responded, accepting the
apology. "So what do you want?" said the guy. "I need a place to stay" he
said. "What do you mean?"  "The police are looking for me." "Uh hu" he said
if this was not news to him. "Why do you think we want we should let you
stay here if the police are looking for you?" Here was exactly the
question. He was about to cross over. The silence was heavy. The police
were not looking for them. No one even knew about them or that they had
been at the accident, except for him. James finally answered, "Because I
need a place to stay." The woman said, "Fine, you can sleep on the couch
tonight."

Jude earned the money. By day he worked as a programmer and made enough to
support them all. He did not mind doing this. He enjoyed is work for the
most part and could not believe how much money they gave him. Jenna
volunteered in a soup kitchen. Dala worked as a social worker with
students.
