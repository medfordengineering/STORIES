From his office window, James watched as a woman across the street yelled
at a man sitting on a bench. He couldn't hear her yell, but he could see
her raised arms and her clenched fists and he could see her open mouth and
her eyes looking down at him as if she might consume him at any moment. The
man looked up and watched her, but did not seem all that concerned. 

The drama across the street was nothing new. James had seen it play out
everyday since he moved into his office four years ago. The cast of
characters varied throughout the year, though there were a few regulars.
Their numbers increased in the summer months and dwindled in the winter. He
had heard that there was a methadone clinic nearby by way of an explanation
for their presence.

They were mostly white, but of assorted shapes, sizes, ages and genders.
They would shout, laugh, gesture, dance, cajole, negotiate, argue, yell and
sometimes even fight, but never to any great effect.  They wore jackets,
pants, sun dresses and skirts, and held hand bags and cell phones just like
everyone else, but they were not like everyone else.

Their lives were not punctuated by the usual changes of venue associated
with work day, evening and weekend.  Their lives unfolded continuously in
this one location each day from morning to night like actors on a perpetual
stage playing for no one but James or so it seemed to him, for no one else
ever seemed to notice them.  

What amazed James most was that they always seemed to be engaged in
conversations, often of apparently vital importance. James wondered what
could be so important. What dramatic conflict was mounting or being
resolved in lives that seemed to have no external consequence. By contrast,
James's generally found any conversation lasting more than 20 minutes
usually required work.

As James looked out his window and watched, his thoughts drifted to his
son. For the past year, he had looked out his window and thought about his
son. For the past year, he has also done so little work, that he felt he
should have been fired or, at the very least, moved to a desk without a
window. He could only assume that his manager felt sorry for him and that
when she weighed the emotional cost of firing him against monetary cost of
his lack of productivity, he came out slightly ahead. He wasn't planning to
argue with her on this point.

Someone had once told him that after a year, you either move on or you
don't.  James was not moving on. A year ago, James's son was hit by car and
killed as he was walking home from school. The driver was not drunk or
senile, just careless and young.

That evening at home as he brushed his teeth before going to bed, he
listened to the sound of traffic outside the open bathroom window. The
sound was not so steady that he couldn't make out the individual vehicles,
a truck then a bus, then a series of cars each with a distinct sound and
moving in different directions. In most cases, it was not the sound of the
car's engine or any sort of mechanical noise that he heard, but the sound
the car made as it pushed through the atmosphere, creating waves in the
air, like the wake from a boat, that violated everything for blocks around.
They entered his house through open windows crashing against every surface.
Even late at night when there were relatively few cars on street out front,
there was still the steady and maddening singular hum that resulted from a
synthesis of the waves from all the traffic for miles around and leaving no
possibility for silence.

James hated cars. He hated their noise. He hated their arrogance. He hated
how they lined every street of his city and how they had become the most
dominate feature of the urban landscape. But mostly he hated them because
of what they had done to Tim. 

The next morning, he stood waiting to cross his street to catch the bus to
work. When he and his wife had moved to this house ten years ago, the
street was mostly quiet. Now there always seemed to be traffic on the
street. Where had all these cars come from he wondered and where were they
all going?

It seemed to take even longer than usual to find a break in the traffic.
First there was traffic on one side of the street and then on the other.
When the street was finally clear on both sides he started across, but just
then a car came out from a side street and was now moving in his direction.
Instead of walking back to the sidewalk, he just stopped where he was in
the street and waited for the car to pass in front of him.  But this car
was followed by another and now there was now a car coming toward him in
the lane where he was standing. He didn't move. He just stood there and
waited.  The car coming toward him stopped and within a short time more
cars backed up behind it. There were still cars traveling on the opposite
side of the street, and so he just stood there.  

After about twenty seconds, one of the cars began to honk, but James did
not move. He began to feel as though he couldn't move as though he needed
to be there, as though he were now a fixture in the pavement.  Even when
there was break in the traffic on the other side of the street, he just
stood there. A few cars tried to dart around him. James just stood there
looking straight ahead. And as he stood there he started to smile to
himself. He smiled at how fragile the whole system suddenly seemed. He
smiled at how one man standing in one lane of a street could, in only a few
minutes, cause cars to back up farther then he could see.

He also thought about his neighbors watching him. He thought about the
people in the cars watching him. He wondered if anyone he knew could see
him standing there in the street. He wondered what they would think. He
figured they would just think he was crazy. Not a bad assumption he
thought.

A few minutes later he heard a siren. He was certain they were coming to
remove him from the street. He felt some relief that there was now a
definite resolution to his situation, one from which he seemed unable to
extricate himself. He almost smiled as he noticed the difficultly the
police car had getting through the traffic, but thought it best not to
betray any emotion.

The police car stopped near him and the officers both got out. One started
to direct traffic around him and the other came over to ask if he was okay.
He said he was and the officer asked if he would mind moving back to the
side walk. James agreed and walked off the street escorted by the officer.

The officer asked him why he was standing in the street and he said he
didn't know. He said he was tired and confused. Looking toward his house,
he could see his wife and daughter inside. He could see them watching him,
embarrassed to come out.  

The officer did not feel the need to site James for any violation, but
walked him back to his house where his wife Sarah had come out to meet
them on the steps. The officer suggested to Sarah that she take James to
the emergency room so that he could be evaluated. She agreed and they went
back inside.

Sarah was worried. James said that he was just trying to cross the street,
and got stuck halfway, not sure what to do. He said he hadn't very slept
well for the past few nights. It was the kind of explanation that only made
sense if you wanted it to make sense. Sarah looked at him without saying
anything. James said he was fine and headed off to work again, but agreed
to walk down to the intersection and cross at the crosswalk.

That evening when he got home from work he found Sarah in the kitchen
making dinner. His daughter had gone to a friend's house for the night. He
felt relieved and then guilty. His relationship with his daughter had
become strained over the last year or was it years.  He could not remember.
He could remember that there was a time when she would run to hug him as
soon as he came in the door. He had heard that the change in their
relationship was just typical adolescent behavior, but he could not help
thinking that it was somehow his fault.

He asked his wife about their plans for the weekend. Not that he cared, he
simply wanted to fill the silence. She said she had talked with her sister,
who was getting divorced and mentioned that she had plans to move back to
the city to be near them. This topic carried the conversation through
dinner. After dinner he said he wanted to go for a bike ride. She let him
go. She had been more than accommodating over the past year as he tried to
find his way back to a normal life.  Though he wondered how long this would
last.

It was early summer and the days were long. He walked his bike to the end
of the driveway and instead of trying to cross the traffic, he set off in
its flow. He had only recently taken up riding a bike again. The last time
he owned a bike was in college. He still felt nervous and awkward. He felt
either too close to the traffic or too close to the cars parked on the side
of the road. He carefully and followed the newly painted bike lanes farther
into the city. 

As he headed into the city the buildings grew larger and closer together.
There were more vehicles and more lanes of traffic. The patterns of traffic
became more complicated with lanes for turning and lanes for going
straight. He felt less certain about exactly where he belonged. It was time
to go home.  As he was about to turn around he heard from behind him people
shouting, whooping and ringing bells. He could tell they were on bikes
because the noise was quickly closing in on him.  

Quickly they were all around him. James felt self-conscious. They were
young and tough and harsh and loud. They wore clothes that were dark and
denim and leather and metal. A few of them smiled at him as if inviting him
to join their fun, but most just ignored him. They were focused the on the
world around them, making sure the world new they were there. 

As they carried him along, James felt a sudden confidence. Protected by
phalanx of more than a dozen bikes, he no longer worried about his place on
the street.

The group came to a traffic light and stopped. James stopped with them.
Some stood over their bikes, but others continued to ride around in circles
as if they were too nervous to stop moving. As they waited for the light to
change, the car directly behind them honked its horn and the group answered
with shouts and bells and jeers. The car honked again and again the group
responded with even more noise. The light was still red. The group began to
focus its attention on the car answering each honk with more shouts and
yells and bike bells.  Finally, the driver leaned out of his window and
yelled, "Get the hell out of the road."

As the light turned green, most of the group moved on but five of the bikes
that had been circling continued to circle in front of the car. James
stayed with them standing over his bike in the lane and in front of the car
and looked ahead. This time he was not alone. The car gunned its engine and
honked and then pushed forward into one of bikes knocking the rider off and
damaging his bike. The rider quickly jumped up, picked up his bike and
threw it at the front window of the car cracking the windshield. He and a
second rider were quickly at the drivers side of the car. One of them
reached in and opened the door and grabbed the driver.

The other bikers continued to ride in circles around the entire scene which
now included the car, their two friends, James and the driver. James just
stood over his bike but was now looking back at what was happening.

The two men pulled the driver from his seat. A woman who had been sitting
beside him screamed. Once out of the car, they were shouting at driver and
pushing him back and forth between them. They stopped him as he tried to
run. Then one grabbed him from behind while the and the other punched him
in the chest and in the face. The sound was not what James expected.

Just then they began to hear the wail of a siren in the distance. One of
the bikers said, "Come on Jason, lets go." Another said, "Jay, lets get out
of here." The man holding the driver dropped him on the pavement near the
car and got on his bike. The other man whose bike had been damaged by the
car walked over to James looked at him for a moment and then pushed him to
the ground, picked up James's bike and rode off with the other four.

When James stood up a woman was yelling at him. The driver of the car was
lying on the ground and not moving. The woman from the car was next to the
man on the ground and crying. A young man was consoling the woman from the
car, another man and woman were attending to the driver, an older man was
trying to keep the crowd that had formed back from the scene. James
wondered at the scene before him, as if actors and not a random assortment
of pedestrians had been waiting in the wings for this very moment. 

James decided that it was time to leave and turned to make his way through
the small crowd which had formed. The woman continued to shout at him but
remained where she had been, seemingly willing to leave her place on the
stage. The crowd hesitantly made way for his exit, uncertain if they should
play a role in the unfolding scene.

James was born in a small town in New Hampshire that had slowly made its
way from rural to suburban. He lived with his mother in a house that
belonged to the latter type and of no particular distinction. It resided
within a cluster of houses equally lacking in any sort of character, houses
that weren't designed so much as built. They served their purpose as basic
shelter including places for sleeping, eating and watching television.

James never knew his father although he did not leave the family until
James was two. If he existed at all it was in a sort of hazy, dream-like
memory that could not be distinguished from a photograph.

James decided to make his way home on foot. The chaotic scene slowly faded
behind him and into the general wash of the city. He was in no hurry to get
home, but was glad to have a destination. His hand throbbed from where he
had scrapped it when he fell, though the blood was already starting to dry.
He noticed that his shirt was torn and there was bike grease on his pants.
But cloaked in the night he felt less conspicuous.

As he walked, his mind bounded over the seemingly disconnected events of
the day. He wanted to arrange these events into a logical sequence finding
cause and effect. He wanted the day to make sense.  Why was he standing in
the street? Why did he tell his wife he was just tired?  Why did the two
men fight? Why did he get punched?

Nothing seemed to make sense and he was was drawn to the scenes playing out
in the late hours of night. Three boys and a girl walking in his direction,
young and drunk, a lazy knot of arms swaying and laughing as they made
their way past. Do they see him? A line of people well dressed and anxious
waiting for their turn to enter a night club. He has never been to a night
club and cannot find empathy. A man leaves liquor store with a bottle of
liquor in a bag. An obvious and logical event but where is he going. Across
the street, a group of boys hop, dance and spin down the sidewalk with
energy and speed but without destination. A car with girls inside drives
by. The young boys shout for their attention. A bottle is tossed and breaks
in the street, but from which party, James cannot tell. 

James does not drink. He has never been to a club. He has never yelled to a
stranger. He feels he shares with them little more than species.

James was finally back on the familiar streets of his neighborhood. Not far
from home he started to feel hungry. Although it was late, he decided to
stop at a sub shop and get a slice of pizza. Inside a young couple sat at a
booth in the window. He eating a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs in a
watery tomato sauce and she watching the television behind his head.  In
another booth an older man had fallen asleep but bothering no one he was
left alone. James sat by himself.  He quickly finished his slice of pizza
but remained in his booth. He realized that in a short time he would be
home.

As he approached his house, he noticed a police car in his driveway. The
car was quiet and empty. He could see that the lights of his first floor
were on although it was well past midnight. He started to run toward his
house and then stopped. Suddenly, he pictured the man in the street, lying
there unconscious ...dead? Was it possible? Why did the woman scream at
him?  What did she think he did? Could the police be looking for him? It
all did not seem possible. And yet there the police car sat in his driveway
in the middle of the night.

He was now close enough to his house to see inside. Under the bright
artificial light of his living room, his wife was standing talking to two
policemen. He watched the way they stood, their expressions but could
discern little helpful information. As he watched he had the sensation of
looking back into his life through a crack, a crack through which he had
accidentally fallen, like a horse finding himself outside the paddock
fence, knowing where he should be, but not knowing where he wants to be. 

He tried to think of an explanation. Maybe there was a robbery in the
neighborhood. Yes, that must be it he thought. All the same, he had no
interest in talking with the police again today. He quickly backed down his
driveway.  He decided to continue walking for another half an hour and
return, sure that the police would be gone by then and his wife would be
asleep.

Inside his house, the same officer who had been there in the morning was
saying to his wife that in order to even file a missing person report, her
husband would to have been missing for at least 24 hours. He also reminded
her that she should have taken him to the emergency room as he suggested.
He promised he would keep a look out and would file an official report as
soon as he could.

A half an hour later James returned to his house. There was no police car.
The house was dark and quiet. He quietly entered and made his way to his
bedroom. Without waking his wife, he slipped into his bed and waited for
sleep to erase the day.

At exactly 7:30, their alarm clock began its steady beat but for a few
minutes was unable to rouse either James or Sarah. Finally Sarah, usually a
light sleeper, pulled herself out of slumber.  Seeing James lying next to
her, she began to rock him awake saying "James, it is 7:30" and then, as he
sat up and looked at her trying to focus, she asked him, "What happened to
you last night?  When did you get home?" James explained about the bike
accident and that he had walked home. As he told his story, she examined
his wounded hand. Holding it, he watched as she gently traced the outline
of his scraped skin. 

She then looked up at him and asked "Are you alright?" "Yes, I am fine." he
said feeling anything but fine. "Why didn't you call me? Don't you think I
worry?" she asked. He responded that by the time he thought to call she
would have been asleep, an excuse which neither he nor she believed. "Why
are you doing this?" she asked in a different tone, one that made him think
she had finally had enough. He wondered why it had taken her so long.
"Doing what?" he said. "Don't you know that I feel everything you feel,
that I also think about him every day and that every time I think about him
my heart aches with a pain so deep that I don't know how I will survive it."
She paused looking at him. "Are you going to go on like this forever?" She
asked. He said he didn't want to but he was not even sure if that was true.

She looked at his hand again, she had not stopped holding it. "Does it
hurt?" "A little" he said, relieved to be asked a question that he could
finally answer honestly.

He made it to work on time. That was one thing you could say for him he
thought as he sat down at his desk at 9am. He was never late for work. He
looked at the stack of folders that were waiting for him. Each folder
contained an insurance claim that he needed to review. Each one a complaint
about some minor tragedy and a demand for monetary compensation. Tragedies
that were perpetrated by acts of God or criminals and directed at the sorts
of objects that could be repaired, rebuilt or replaced, but never made the
same. That was how the world worked. Nothing ever returned to its original
state.  

His job was to find the flaw in their story, evidence that their loss was
not as worthy as claimed. When he first got the job he had enjoyed the
work. He felt he was a good arbitrator of justice bestowing fair judgement
on those who deserved and those who did not. 

Later that morning, he got a call from one of the secretaries requesting
that he meet with Denise, the division supervisor at the end of the day.
She was his bosses boss. He had only met with her a few times before. Once
when he was first hired.

As he entered she was just finishing a phone call and pointed to a seat in
front of her desk. After putting down the phone, she asked him how he was
doing. She said she was sorry for his loss and that it must be terrible.
She looked at him with that same sort of smile that he had seen on so many
other faces as if she were trying to feel his sadness. It seemed to him an
odd human instinct that was both impossible and useless.

She then looked down at some papers and began to review his job performance
over the past year and it finally dawned on him what was happening. As she
spoke he could feel his perspective shift as if he were now looking down on
her from somewhere halfway up the wall. She did not seem to notice. He
could hear her as she reviewed the numbers of claims he had processed over
various periods of time.  Apparently for one six week period he had done
absolutely nothing. He heard himself respond acknowledging everything she
said. He heard her talk about understanding and responsibility, but he just
wanted the conversation to be over.  He wanted her to stop. If he had had a
white flag he would have waved it.  Finally he heard her say, "I'm sorry."
which seemed to her a way of summing up everything she had said. He said
"Thank you" and left. 

As he made his way back to his desk he felt no one looking at him. He sat
at his desk looking at the stack of unprocessed claims. Why had they given
him so many. Were they offering him one last chance to show that whatever
they saw in him when he was hired was still there. He picked up a photo of
his family that he kept in the top drawer. He looked around, not sure what
else to take.  There was nothing else that was his. He did not want to be
accused of stealing. 

His termination was effective immediately she had said, but he would be
given six weeks pay. He wondered if that was why he had said thank you. He
was getting a compensation for his tragedy. That made sense. After all this
was the company's line of work. But this was no act of God or violation of
the law, it was simply a legal and justified decision, so how could assign
a figure
thought, nonetheless. He wondered how she had come up with a figure of six
weeks paybut who was he to judge., but after all she was an expert in this
sort of thing. She had started her career in his job as she had told him
when he was first hired. He guessed that he was supposed to one day become
her, but he had failed.


He walked out the door. The sun was low and bright.  He crossed the street
to the plaza across from his office. The plaza he watched every day instead
of doing his work. The people, his friends, where there. They had taken up
positions on benches through out the plaza creating a microcosm of as if
each one had a role to play in their part of the plaza, like the banker,
baker and fire station in a small town. The others would flit about stopping
in at each of the different to chat. He sat at bench outside the imaginary
boundary of their world.

He wondered what they did. Where did they go at night? Everyone went
somewhere at night. He imagined that when darkness fell complete, they just
stopped where they were, like windup creatures whose springs had finally
released all of their stored energy, stuck in whatever final pose. Waiting
for a worker to come round before dawn and wind them back up again.

It began to rain.
By 8pm a group of them seemed in a hurry to leave. The shelter closes at
9pm. 







James stands at the end of his driveway and looks back at his house from
behind a juniper bush. Maybe he is daring the police to catch him. Maybe he
wants them to catch him. Suddenly he sees one of the officers at his front
door. James turns and runs down the sidewalk. At the first side street, he
turns, toward the end of the street he ducks into a dark parking lot.  He
sits down against a fence hidden by a dumpster and laughs quietly feeling
like a child who has just escaped in a game of hide and seek. It is the
first time he can remember laughing in months.

Sitting, hidden, he now has time to question his actions, but all he tells
himself is that her sister is coming to live and will make a far better
partner than he. He gets up. He must disappear.

He needs to sleep to find a place to sleep. He has never stayed up all
night and this 

Even though he no need to be at work in the morning, it
is a tough habit to break.


He needed to sleep. After 30 years of sleeping every night it was a hard
On the street he is moving quickly away from home but to where? His first
thought is that he needs to find a place to sleep for the night, but then
challenges this thought. Is this just a convention, the sort of convention
to which he is no longer obliged? He has no plans to go to work in the
morning or any plans whatsoever. 

ot going to work in the morning. so why sleep?  could just stay up all
night, sleep on the subway when he got tired. No, his present need for
sleep is real, but where? James' world is one where people sleep indoors.
They sleep in their rooms and they sleep in their Ieds. They sleep safely
protected under walls and sheets and blankets.

He could find a hotel. He has some money. No, he no longer has any more
money than the cash in his wallet. He is disappearing 

He needs to be where he does not stand out. He needs to leave this world.
This world has homes. It is not that he will be seen or recognized. No one
knows him. Even his neighbors would barely recognize him. It is that he
would stand out. But there is no one to see him. He needs protection.  

The streets were quiet. He walked in the hours between good and bad, when
the bad had given up and gone to bed and the good were still waiting for
the dawn to start their day.

Once in the park, he followed the path around a small pond. The moon
provided more light than he had imagined. Leaving the path near a small
wooded hill, he scouted for a location that would offer the most privacy.
As he left the path he became aware of the sound of his footsteps, but he
was certain there was no one around to hear him.

He settled on a spot near a rock that provided some protection though it
was unclear who else would be coming through the park at night. He simply
lay down on the ground moving a few rocks and sticks until he felt
reasonably comfortable. He would need to be gone early in the morning. He
guessed that joggers would be in the park by 6am. He decided he would take
the first bus into the city. Getting up early had never been a problem. He
was sure he would be up at first light. As he closed his eyes he could hear
the constant hum of an expressway not far from the park.

The next morning he was up even before the sun and made his way to the bus
stop. On the bus were mostly those who were starting a morning shift or
leaving a night shift. People who worked in occupations that were open
around the clock or people who where just riding somewhere like him. He
felt out of place, but no one paid much attention to him. He inventoried
his needs, clothing, shelter and food.

He felt uncomfortable in his clothes like they were part of a different
world than the one he was entering. A kid a few seats in front of him wore
a mohawk and a large studded jacket, no one paid much attention to him
either.

His first destination was a Goodwill that operated downtown. He tried to
pick out clothes that he would not have normally picked out and that maybe
did not fit quite right. Maybe he just needed to be in clothes that were
not his. His purcahse included a hat. The new clothes cost him a total of
$15 dollars.  He put his old ones in his backpack.

His next stop was a diner. It was already noon and he was famished. He knew
he should save his money, but he was not quite ready to go to a meal
program nor did he know where to find one. For this meal he would use the
money in his wallet, but that was not going to last. As he scanned the menu
he tried to estimate dollars per calorie and tried to find the best deal.
After he ordered his meal, he looked in his wallet at all the cards that
identified him. He separated them into a stack and placed them in his
outside pocket.  He would drop them in the first trashcan he found. 

After his meal he headed downtown to find a place to stay for the night. He
knew the name of at least one shelter, but did not know where it was
located. He wandered around downtown for a while hoping to just happen
across a shelter, but did not find anything. He then found a payphone with
a yellow page book attached and was able to look up an address. He walked
to make sure he could find the place. Now that he knew where he needed to
go he decided to head to the city library for a place to spend the day. 

The library had been built in the 1920s and was one of the majestic
buildings of the city. The large cool open space of the great room retained
its elegance as the city went through transformations from rich to poor and
back again. James just wandered the shelves looking for a book to read.
Choosing a book was always hard. He finally found something to read and
settled into a chair on the second floor of the building near a window. 

For the moment, his life seemed pretty good. Less than five pages into the
book he fell asleep. His head leaned back against the chair. He awoke two
hours latter and spent the rest of the afternoon reading. Around 6pm he
decided to leave and head over to the shelter, nervous about the night
ahead.

He arrived at the shelter around


Sitting at the table he began to notice his hands and his skin. This was
skin that had spent most of its life out of the sun. It was smooth and
unweathered. Any cuts he had received had been carefully attended to so
that little if any scaring remained. His hands were not caloused from
manual labor. Even more so, he thought about his teeth that were all in
place and neatly ordered. These physical attributes he could not alter nor
disguise and they defined him as someone who had lived a comfortable and
affluent life. He would try to cover them up as best he could.

With no job and no money, he had not choice about his place in society.
With each niche there were requirements such as age, race and income.
Certain ones were only achieved by income. Some you just fell into by age
or social status. He could no more be a punk or valley girl. Though all of
these required some income, if only for the basic attire that the social
class expected. The status of homeless or transient required no capital of
any kind. In fact, it was the requirement. In that way it was a sort of
exclusive club. You could visit or pretend, but you could not truly belong
if you had capital assets. 

The next night after he stayed in the park he was waiting in line for
transport to one of the city shelters. He was not sure which shelter he
was going to but he had seen people lining up here for years and knew that
these were where people lined up to go to shelters for the evening. As the
line moved forward people were checked for intoxication. Even here levels
of status remained and he fit in the right crowd.

When he arrived at the shelter he was assigned a cot in the men's room. He
immediately recognized people. Some of the people who he saw outside his
window. Here the formed a group of friends, a clique and did not mingle
much with the others. Just the men. They generally seemed more subdued
here. He was able to get a meal and a shower.      

He did not have a bag for his belongings, because he had no belongings and
this alone set him apart. 

His days continued like this for a while. It seemed so easy to hide in
plain site. He spent his days at the library and nights in the shelter. He
was not well fed, but was not starving either. He was not sure how long it
would last before someone recognized him.

But where was he going. What was the goal of this exercise. He had always
had a purpose or at least a path and direction. But now there seemed to be
no path. He was not moving forward. He had a pattern to his day but there
was no sense of progressing. He felt that he was in a holding pattern
circling in the sky and waiting to land or waiting for what would happen
next. And this made him anxious.
 




He sat in the new section of the library with windows that looked onto the
street. The old section had been built for the purpose of the secure
storage of books and general access. The new portion of the library had
been build as a public space in the model of a cutting edge department
store with three floors of products and glass walls looking out on the
public. 

Sitting in his usual spot, James looked out over the sidewalk. As he did he
noticed two people walking down the sidewalk together. One was pushing a
bike. He immediately recognized them as two of the bikers from the evening
of the incident. One was the guy who held the driver of the car and the
other was one of the girls. At first he froze afraid they might see him,
but then he realized he needed to follow them.  


quickly decided to follow them. He was excited by the prospect
of finding out where they lived and about contacting them.

He made his way out of the library and down to the sidewalk behind them.
They walked for blocks through the city. The walked into an urban
neighborhood just outside the city. They walked father than most people
walked. He imagined himself as a detective, but they did not seem to be
suspicious. As he followed them he imagined meeting them and what he would
say.

They reached a two family home that looked as if it were rented to students
and went inside. James stood on the street near the house and could not
decide what to do. He thought about in college how he and some friends had
walked to party, but then stood outside the house afraid to go in. He felt
self conscious in his new role and was now out side of his routine not sure
how he looked standing on the street.    

Finally, he went up and knocked on the door. After a few minutes a woman
answered and opened the door just enough to . He recognized her from the
evening. She was one of the ones who had smiled at him when they first
began riding together. She did not seem to recognize him and he became
again aware of his disguise. "How can I help you" she said in tone that
assumed she was in no way interested in helping him. "I was at the
accident" he said. "What accident?" "The one where the man in the car hit
your friends bike and then was pulled from the car." He did not want to add
and then beaten. Her eyes narrowed slightly as she recognized him and then
she said, "Hold on" and closed the door. He could here people talking
behind the door. She opened the door again.  She asked him "What do you
want?" He said, he wanted to come in. She said, "Sorry, I think you must
have the wrong house." and closed the door. 

James stood there, for a moment wondering if he could be wrong, but no he
was sure. He banged on the door again. There was a pause and then the same
woman answered the door and said, "What do you want, you don't belong
here." and then the man moved beside her in the door way and said, "If you
don't go away we will have you arrested for trespassing." James again said,
"I want to come in." The man exasperated said, "What are you doing here?
You think you saw some people beat up some guy a few weeks ago and you
think someone here looks like one of those people but you are mistaken so
you need to go away." "I don't have anywhere else to go" said James. I have
been living in a shelter since the accident and I won't be able to stay
there for much longer. "Wait, what are you talking about?" said the man.
"You have been living in a shelter? Who are you? Why don't you just go
home." "I can't go home. The police are looking for me." "And why are the
police looking for you?" asked the man in a tone that clearly indicated he
did not believe this. "Because of the accident." he said. "I am desperate."
he added and then "My son was killed by a car." The man rolled his eyes as
if none of this made any sense. Then he and the woman closed the door.
James waited. A few moments later, they opened the door and let him in. The
man said, "If any of this is bullshit, you are dead." The woman said,
"Don't mind Jay, he can be a little dramatic." "Well, we really don't need
another mouth to feed." said Jay. "Don't worry, he doesn't look like he
eats too much" said the other man who had been with Jay at the accident.

The other man, whose name was Jude, brought James down to the basement and
showed him a cot. He said that James should stay there till they called
him. They needed to talk.

Upstairs the five people who had been at the accident and who lived
together in the house sat down on a set of mis-matched living room
furniture. "The guy is crazy" said Jay.  "Well, being crazy is "We don't
need him going to the police." Said Katherine. "So what is going to stop
him" asked Mike. "We just take him with us." said Jay. "He freely comes
along and freely participates in a nights activity. After that, he is going
to be much less likely to go to the police." "Can he really ride a bike?"
asked Jude. "I guess, we'll see." said Jay. "So for now, he just stays in
our basement and eats our food?" asked Mike. "It is bad enough having one
freeloader" said Jude smiling. "I am sure we can find something for him to
do during the day." said Katherine. 

Jude called down the stairs and said that James could come up. They all
introduced themselves. That night he ate a meal that Jay cooked. The next
morning everyone went to work except Jay. Jude and Katherine were
programmers who made a lot of money. Mike worked in a grocery store and
Mary worked as a councilor for teenagers with substance abuse. Jay stayed
home and took care of the house. He was the brains!

He noticed his bike on the back porch. Oh that piece of crap.  

That evening after dinner, Jay asked James if he would like to go on a ride
with them. James said sure. "You could use your own bike" said Jay. 





She said, "Okay" and opened the door to allow
him inside. 

When he came in the guy who had lost his bike at the accident was standing
there just behind her. He said, "So you're the guy whose bike I stole. It
was a total piece of crap." James, just said "sorry" but then realized that
he did not exactly owe him and apology. "No problem" he responded,
accepting the apology. "So what do you want?" said the guy. "I need a place
to stay" he said. "What do you mean?"  "The police are looking for me." "Uh
huh" he said if this was not news to him. "Why do you think we want we
should let you stay here if the police are looking for you?" Here was
exactly the question. He was about to cross over. The silence was heavy.
The police were not looking for them. No one even knew about them or that
they had been at the accident, except for him. James finally answered,
"Because I need a place to stay." The woman said, "Fine, you can sleep on
the couch tonight."

Jude earned the money. By day he worked as a programmer and made enough to
support them all. He did not mind doing this. He enjoyed is work for the
most part and could not believe how much money they gave him. Jenna
volunteered in a soup kitchen. Dala worked as a social worker with
students.
