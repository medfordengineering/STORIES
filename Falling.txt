From his office window, James watched as a woman across the street yelled
at a man sitting on a bench. He couldn't hear her yell, but he could see
her waving her arms and he could see the tension in her body.  The man
looked up at her, but did not seem all that concerned. 

The drama across the street was nothing new. James had seen it play out
everyday since he moved into his office four years ago. The cast of
characters varied throughout the year, though there were a few regulars.
Their numbers increased in the summer and dwindled in the winter. He has
heard that there was a methadone clinic nearby by way of an explanation for
their presence.

They were mostly white, but of assorted shapes, sizes, ages and genders.
They would shout, laugh, gesture, dance, cajole, negotiate, argue, yell and
sometimes even fight, but never to any great effect.  They wore jackets,
pants, sundresses and skirts, and held hand bags and cell phones just like
everyone else, but they weren't like everyone else though it was hard to
put your finger on exactly why. 

Their lives were not punctuated by the usual changes of venue associated
with work day, evening and weekend. Their lives just rolled along
continuously in this one location each day from morning to night like
actors on a perpetual stage. What amazed James most was that no matter when
he looked out the window they seemed to be engaged in conversations and
often ones of apparently vital importance. What could they possibly be
talking about thought James. James could barely think of what to say to
his wife after being away at work for the whole day.

As James looked out his window and watched, his thoughts drifted to his
son. For the past year, he had looked out his window and thought about his
son. For the past year, he has also done so little work, that he felt he
should have been fired or, at the very least, moved to a desk without a
window. He just assumed that his manager felt sorry for him and that when
she weighed the emotional cost of firing him against monitary cost of his
job he came out slightly ahead. He wasn't planning to argue with her on
this point.

Someone had once told him that after a year, you either move on or you
don't.  James was not moving on. A year ago, James's son was hit by
car and killed as he was walking home from school. The driver was not
drunk or senile, just careless and probably texting, though this was
never proven. 

That evening as he brushed his teeth, he could hear the traffic outside his
house through the open windows. When he moved to his house ten years ago,
the street was mostly quiet. Now there always seemed to be cars on the
street with substantial traffic in morning and evening.  Where had all
these cars come from he wondered and where were they all going?

James hated cars. He hated them because of what they had done to Tim. He
hated their noise and their smell. He hated how they dominated his city
divi into tiny blocks and that no matter where you went you were constatly
crossing these giant swaths of asphault. He hated how they lined every
street filling every vacant nook replacing humans as the most prominate
urban feature. 

The next morning, he stood waiting to crosss the cross his street to catch
the bus to work. This morning it seemed to take even longer than usual.
When the road was finally clear he started, but just then a car came out
from a side street. It headed down the opposite side of the street in his
direction. Instead of walking back to the sidewalk to wait again, he
stopped where he was in the lane and waited for the car to pass.  But the
car was followed by another and now there was now a car coming toward him
on his side of the street. He didn't move. He just stood there and waited.
The car coming toward him stopped and within a short time more cars backed
up behind it. Since there were still cars traveling on the opposite side of
the street, he just stood there.  

After about twenty seconds, one of the cars began to honk, but James did
not move. He began to feel as though he couldn't move as though he now
belonged there, as though he were now a fixture in the pavement. Even when
there was break in the traffic on the other side of the street, he just
stood there. A few cars tried to race around him when it was clear. James
just stood there looking straight ahead. And then he started to smile to
himself. He smiled at how fragile the whole system suddenly seemed, how one
man standing in one lane of a road could, in under a few minutes, cause
cars to back up farther then he could see.

He also thought about his neighbors watching him. He thought about the people
in the cars watching him. He wondered if anyone he knew could see him standing
there in the street. He wondered what they would think. He figured they would
just think he was crazy. Not a bad assumption he thought.

A few minutes later he heard a siren. He was certain they were coming to
remove him from the street and he felt some relief that there was now a
definite resolution to his situation. He almost smiled as he noticed the
difficultly the police car had getting through the traffic, but thought it
best not to betray any emotion for the moment.

The police car stopped near him and the officers both got out. One started to
direct traffic around him and the other came over to ask if he was okay. He
said he was and the officer asked if he would mind moving back to the side
walk. James agreed and walked off the street escorted by the officer.

The officer asked him why he was standing in the street and he said he
didn't know. He said he was tired and confused. His wife and daughter
where inside the house. He could see them watching him, afraid to come out.  

The officer did not feel the need to site James for any violation, but
walked him back to his house where his wife Brenda came out to meet them on
the steps. The officer suggested to Brenda that she take James to the
emergency room so that he could be evaluated. She agreed and they went back
inside.

Brenda was worried. James said that he was just trying to cross the street,
but got stuck halfway and was not sure what to do. He said he hadn't very
slept well for the past few nights. It was the kind of explanation that
only made sense if you wanted it to make sense. Brenda looked at him
without saying anything. James said he was fine and headed off to work
again, but agreed to walk down to the intersection to cross at the
crosswalk.

That night when he got home from work the house felt even quiter than
usual.  Brenda was in the kitchen making dinner. His daughter had gone
to a friend's house for the night. His relationship with his daughter
had become strained over the last year or was it years. He could not
remember how long. He could remember that there was a time when she
would run to hug him as soon as he came in the door.  He had heard
that this change was just typical adolescent behavior, but he could
not help thinking that it was somehow his fault.

He talked with his wife about his day, but not about the morning. She had
some news about her sister's divorce and whether or not she was going to
move back to the city to be near them. After dinner he said he wanted to go
for a bike ride. She let him go. She had been more than accomodating over
the past year as he tried to find his way back to a normal life. Though he
wondered how long this would last.

It was the beginning of summer and the days were long. When he got to the
end of his driveway instead of trying to cross traffic, he set off in its
flow. He had learned to ride a bike as kid, but had not ridden much until
recently. He followed the newly painted bike lanes farther into the city. 

Riding always felt good, but he was still not very confident. He rode
slowly and stayed as close to the right side of the road as he could.

. As he the buildings were larger and . He felt
tense but this was good. He still felt like a novice. There were lots of
people on bikes these days and there seemed to be a sort of very cool bike
culture. All these people seemed to know much more than him. He probably
looked like a dork, but he could not tell. He tried to figure out. His
bike was not that old, but he purchased it used. It had a lot of features
and gears, but did not look like the bikes the cool people rode. The sun
was low in the sky highlighting all the features with a soft contrast. The
night was cool. He liked being out and not inside a car. 

It was getting late and he was starting to head back home. Behind him he
began to hear people shouting, whooping and ringing bells. He could tell
they were on bikes because the noise was quickly closing in on him. Then
they were all around him dressed in wild clothing, dark, freyed and studded
with metal. They wore tatoos. He was now riding with this group. They
seemed to be intentionally keeping pace with him.  A few smiled at him as
if inviting him to join their fun, though most ignored him.

Surrounded by these bikes he suddenly felt safe on the road, as if the
formed a protective armour against the traffic. As they approached a
traffic light the group stopped, though some continued to ride in small
circles as they waited for the light to change. They were loud.  They
wanted to be seen. They wanted to be heard. This behavior only added to his
sense of safety. There was no suspense. No waiting to be accosted for
misbehavior. The war was on and they were fighting it all around him and
protecting him. They were young and dressed in way that felt intimidating
not in way that suggested tough but not violent but tough in a way that
suggested exclusion.

As they waited for the light to change, the car directly behind them began
to honk its horn in a manner that did not signify an attempt commradery with
the riders hoots and hollars, but get out of the road. The light was
still red. The group began to focus its attention on this car. Answering
each honk with shouts, yells and their own bells. Finally, the driver
leaned out of his window and yelled, "Get out of the road."

As the light turned green, most of the group moved on but the five bikes
that had been circling continued to circle in front of the car. James
stayed with them standing over his bike in the lane and in front of the car
and looked ahead. This time he was not alone. The car gunned its engine and
pushed forward into one of bikes knocking rider off and damaging the bike.
The rider quickly jumped up, picked up his bike and threw it at the front
window of the car breaking the windsheild. He and second rider were quickly
at the drivers side of the car. One of them eached in and opened the door.

The other bikers continued to ride in small circles around the scene
forming a protective circle. James just stood over his back but was now
looking back at the scene. 

The two men pulled the driver from his seat. A woman who had been sitting
beside him screamed. The bikers were shouting at driver and pushing him.
They trapped him as he tried to run. Then one grabbed him from behind while
the and the other punched him.

Just then they began to hear the wail of a siren in the distance. One of
the bikers said, "Come on Jason, lets go." Another said, "Jay, lets get out
of here." The man holding the driver dropped him on the pavement near the
car and got on his bike. The other man whose bike had been damged by the
car walked over to James and pushed him to the ground. He picked up Jame's
bike and rode off with the other four.

When James stood up a woman was yelling at him. It was not the woman from
the car but another woman who had joined the scene. The woman from the car
was looking distraught and being consoled by another person. was with the
driver lying in the street along with a few other pedestrians who where
attending to him. Another person was trying to consol the woman from the
car. 

People who were simply pedestrians suddenly take on take on new roles as if
they were internally assigned. 

James noticed that at the scene of an accident an audience forms and actors
emerge from the to take on roles to fill out the scene. The woman yelling
at him had taken on the role of defending the victim by James decided that
it was time to leave and turned to make his way through the crowd. The
woman did not follow him, afraid to leave the stage.

James was born.
