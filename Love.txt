Only fifteen minutes into his lecture, Professor Zeretski had already
filled most of the blackboard with equations. After writing each equation,
he turned to his audience and tapped the board with his chalk as if to
emphasize that numbers, more than words, could be relied on to carry truth.
But the truth was that his latest discovery sounded outlandish, maybe too
outlandish, when described in plain English.

His audience, six men and one woman, were sitting around a long and
expensive conference table in a room far above the streets of Manhattan. On
the walls hung paintings of sailing yachts set in elegant wooden frames.
Each one hardly distinguishable from the next to the casual observer and
whose only intention was to convey a sense of confidence in their viewer.

Through the windows it was possible to see, far below, people wrapped in
fall attire making their way silently and with haste toward another day of
work, but none of this had the attention of the people around the table. 

The blackboard, out of place in the room, had been brought in for
Zeretski's presentation. No one had spoken since he began his lecture, but
the patience of the men around the table was beginning to wear as they
started looking at each other with glances that confided how little they
understood of what he was saying.

The one woman in the room was the professor's lab assistant, Judith Kitts.
A woman in her early 30s who had worked for almost a decade. She was the
reason he was here and arranging this meeting had not been easy, but the
professor needed money and these were the sort of people who could give it
to him. 

Finally, Mr. Jonson, one of the older gentlemen at the table, cleared his
throat and interrupting Zeretski said, "Professor, with the likely
exception of Ms. Kitts, we have only the vaguest notion of what you are
talking about. Do you think you could explain your latest discovery in
less..well...scientific terms?"

Professor Zeretski paused for a moment and stared out the window as if
something else had caught his attention. He then turned back to look at
Jonson and said, "I have discovered love." "Love?" said Jonson. "Love?"
thought Judith. Well, that was certainly an exaggeration, but at least he
had their attention. 

"My dear professor, I do hope you have not come here just to tell us that
you have fallen in love." "No, No" smiled the professor as if he were in on
the joke. "I have discovered the force of attraction between humans. Not
only have I discovered what causes this attraction. I know how to make it
happen."

"Are you saying you know how to make people fall in love?" Said Mr.
Franklin, who together with Jonson, directed the investment firm of
Franklin and Jonson.  "Not love exactly. I have discovered the force of
attraction that exists between people, what makes them close friends or
mortal enemies. Just like the fundamental forces of gravity or magnetism,
human attraction is a quantifiable force that can pull people together or
push them apart." 

"Maybe you can help Halpern here" said one of the younger men at the table,
gesturing toward the man sitting next to him. "He's been chatting up the
barmaid at The Four Horses for weeks now and she still won't give him the
time of day."

"Then scientifically speaking, there is no attraction between them." said
Zeretski. "Oh, I wouldn't say that. Poor Halpern is half mad for the young
lady, and with good reason, I might add." Halpern tired to smile, but was
not entirely comfortable with this discussion of his personal life.

"No" responded the professor shaking his head. "Young Halpern is no more
attracted to the barmaid than this a wooden chair could feel an attraction
to the most powerful magnet on earth. The attraction between humans" he
continued, "behaves like any other force. It must be mutual."

Zeretski then lifted a glass of water off the table and held it above the
floor. "While it is easy imagine the massive Earth pulling the tiny glass,
it is harder to imagine the tiny glass pulling the massive Earth. But the
fact is that the attraction and between the two objects is the same."
Dropping the glass on the carpeted floor, he said, "The only reason the
Earth moves so little is simply its size."

As the glass lay on the floor, he addressed Halpern directly "You feel like
you are supposed to like this barmaid and so you invent an artificial
sense of attraction where none exists." The room was silent for a moment as
everyone around the table contemplated their own relationships with wives,
friends and family.

Judith considered her own life. What did she know about love anyway? Her
knowledge of the subject came mostly from novels, movies and the
confidences of her few friends. 

The conversation turned to the status of Zeretski's discovery, specifically
what proof he had for his claims. Zeretski confessed that, to date, his
only experiments had been with animals, to be precise two mice which he
revealed were named Harold and Helen. The names were Judith's suggetion,
taken from a novel she had been reading at the time and a suggestion she
now regretted.

The tone of the meeting shifted again with the gentlemen poking subtle fun
at the notion of two mice in love. Judith understood their skepticism, but
not their lack of respect for a man who had won the Nobel Prize for physics
at the age of 28. Men who had nothing to show for their work but their
money. 

Zeretski had submitted his first paper to the Journal of Physics when he
was only sixteen and a student at the University of Budapest.  Shortly
after, he was recruited to Princeton University where he completed his
Nobel prize winning work on electronic transfer, which had led to the low
cost electrification of cities and towns throughout the country.

By his mid-thirties, he was a well known public figure and a highly prized
guest at society events. His advise was sought by heads of industry and
even the President of the United States.

With substantial financial backing, he built a large laboratory in the
warehouse district of Manhattan with a staff which at its peak numbered 34.
Over time, his work produced some moderately successful discoveries but
nothing that seemed to live up to the moniker "The Great Zeretski", as he
been dubbed in the papers and a title he showed no embarrasement in
hearing.  

Zeretski wanted to press diamonds from coal, move matter through space, and
power cities with bolts of lightning, "harness the very heavens themselves"
as he was quoted as saying. It was unclear what drove him as he had no
serious rivals in his field, but it was clear that his failures did nothing
to dampened his ambition.

When there was nothing substantial to show for his work, he took to giving
garish demonstrations that often included showers of sparks and plumes of
smoke, demonstrations that bordered on theater. He was soon labeled a mad
scientist and he played the part well. 

Judith sometimes wondered if Zeretski himself could distinguish what was
real from what was make believe or that maybe in desperation he believed he
might conjure real science from well crafted theater.  But Judith was
convinced that his most recent work, their work, was quite real.

After the meeting, Jonson and Franklin met privately in Jonson's office.
"What do you think of Zeretski's claims?" asked Jonson. "It is either the
most important discovery of our century or just another one of his crackpot
ideas." said Franklin.  "Mice." Jonson mused to himself as he leaned back
in his chair "What sort of proof are mice?" "If we could get a scientist we
trust to listen to his claims, we might be in a better position to judge."
said Franklin. "Not likely" said Jonson launching forward in is chair. "He
is completely paranoid. I guess I did not mention that he would only allow
members of the firm at the meeting." "Then what was he doing with all those
equations and scientific jargon in front of a group of bankers?" asked
Franklin. "Hard to say, but how else do you really explain his sort of
work?" 

"The question is, is it worth trying to find out more?" asked Franklin.  "I
say yes." said Jonson. "It won't cost that much and the potential is
enormous." "Should I call Mueller?" asked Franklin.  "I think so. Let's get
him started with the usual contract."

Stanley Mueller was listed under private detectives in the Yellow Pages
though only because there was no heading for criminal. To be fair, he did
investigative work, but his work often and intentionally crossed legal
boundaries. 

Stanley was both tough and handsome and was equally comfortable using
either of these assets to get what he wanted. He bore no particular malice
toward the world or anyone in it, he just liked to get things done.

He had grown up in the city, dropped out before finishing high school and
moved from a life on the streets to his present occupation. His initial
employment had mostly been as a thug working for various mob bosses, but he
was reasonably smart and had a repuation for working discretely.  Through a
series of chance meetings he had been introduced to a class of gentlemen,
though not defined as criminals, were willing to employ his sort of help
once in a while. 

As a result, he made a decent living. In his mid-thirties, he lived alone
dating a series of women until each one realized that the present state of
Stanley Mueller would bare little difference to the future state of Stanley
Mueller. The only ticking clock he heard in his head was the one marching
him steadily through life.

After Stanley's meeting with Franklin and Jonson, he arrived back at his
apartment to find a note from his present girlfriend letting him know that
she was out for the afternoon, but would be back with dinner. Immediately,
he regretted giving her a key his apartment. He was getting soft in his old
age he chuckled to himself. He looked in his fridge for lunch, but there
were few reasonable candidates. He had to admit that having a regular and
decent meal might be a life improvement. 

He headed out to local diner and sat thinking about his new contract. It
seemed straight forward enough, find and copy information about an
invention that dealt with some sort of force that existed between humans.
The idea seemed kinda crazy, but who was he to judge. The hardest part
seemed to be how to find the specific information his clients needed, but
there had been a scientist at the meeting who had apparently worked with
Zeretski in the past and let him know exactly what he should look for and a
good idea as to where to find it. Still, how would he be sure about what
was important and what was not? For now, he just had to figure out how to
get in to Zeretski's lab.

That evening after the meeting, Judith sat in the kitchen of the apartment
she shared with her mother reading the society section of the paper.
Following the trials and tribulations of the locally famous was a guilty
pleasure. Her mother sat across from her and talked to her about her day
which usually included shopping and some complaint about the butcher or the
grocer or someone who passed her too closely in the street, percieved daily
slights that seemed to punctuate and confirm her existence. Judith
responded with nods and "hmmms" which her mother took as affrimation.

The truth was that Judith wanted nothing to do with her mother's life and
imagined the day when she would leave.

Two weeks after the meeting, Judith was seated at the bar of the San Marco.
The San Marco was a small but lively club with a jazz band that played a
few nights a week. In front of the band was a dance floor surrounded by
intimate candle-lit tables complete with well-dressed couples in neatly
pressed attire that shined and sparkled. The crowd talked, laughed, drank
and smoked and by early evening spilled onto the dance floor propelled
toward chaos by their collective nervous tension and held in check only by
the constant rythm of the music.

She had started going there with a friend after work, but over time her
friend had lost interest. Judith continued going in the hope that she might
meet someone but the only men who washed up on the barstool next to her
were too old, too shabby or too drunk. Still it was better than being home.
She mostly passed the time reading a novel.

Judith sat her usual spot at the end of the bar which was set against back
wall of the club and separated from the tables and dance floor by a row of
booths. The bartender usually greeted her when she arrived her but mostly
left her alone.

That evening the club felt more crowded than usual. A few minutes after she
sat down, she heard the man sitting next ask if he could buy her a drink.
Her initial instinct was to just get up and leave. The last couple of weeks
at work had been stressful. The mere prospect of financial salvation cast a
sharp contrast against the certainty of their financial predicament making
it all the less bearable. She could not imagine her life without Zeretski
and the lab and she was not in the mood for another disapointing prospect.

But she was enjoying her book and did not want to go home. Without looking
up she said "No thank you", and waited for the bartender to find her. The
man then asked her what she was reading. Barely turning her head she named
the title of the book and the author. 

"Say, do you think that is Hadley Mason?" the man said, indicating a
gentleman seated on the other side of the bar and who looked nothing like
Hadley Mason, a recent sensation on Broadway.

She turned to follow the direction of the man's finger and then realizing
the farce turned further to find to a handsome face, far more handsome than
belonged in her section of the bar. She paused and for a moment thought
that maybe he was lost, mistakenly flung from the crowd and not quite
realizing where he had landed. 

Looking at him she tried to comprehend the situtation, on its face a simple
proposition, but from her perspective it was like looking at a puzzel with
pieces that did not fit. Cute boys had talked with her before, but only in
high school and only to tease her. One would start to flirt with her and
than laugh out-loud joined by his friends. The humor captured in the
absurdity of the proposal. It was in this way that she learned the limits
of her physical attraction. A far more accurate reflection than any mirror
could provide.

But he was no high school student and there were no friends waiting by his
side for the joke to unfold. 

Filling the awkward silence he smiled and said, "Well, on second thought, I
guess my doctor is right, I do need glasses." She smiled too. "My name is
Stanley" he said holding out his hand.  He always gave his real name. He
found that false names posed more of a potential hazard. 

After a short time, he steered the conversation to her work. She told him
she worked for Walter Zeretski. "Wow, The Great Zeretski?" he exclaimed,
"Is he really..." he paused to judge her reaction. "He is quite a
character." she admitted. "I don't tell too many people this," he said,
"but as a kid, he was my hero.  I wanted to be a scientist, but could'nt
afford college." adding that he had to settle for being a salesman for a
large electronics manufacturer.  

"What is he working on now?" he asked. She wanted to tell him about their
latest work, about their theories about the forces that bind people
together, but Zeretski had made her swear to reveal nothing about this
latest discovery. She was unsure what lead to this sudden need for secrecy.
What made this discovery so different? Was it more real or unreal?

"Oh you know, he is still trying to harness the very heavens." She said and
talked about his efforts to store the energy from bolts of lightning.

"I used to try to read his books, but could never understand a thing." he
confessed, "but I thought that at least I looked smart" he laughed. As he
spoke he wondered if there was any truth to what he was saying. Making up
stories about his past came so easily to him, he sometimes wondered if it
could it all be fiction. Maybe, as a kid he did want to be a scientist. How
much of his childhood did he actually remember anyway? 

He asked if she would give him a tour of the lab. She promised she would
ask. He felt he had gotten as far as he could without raising suspicion and
turned the conversation to the war in Europe, a topic that was increasingly
hard to ignore. He agreed with her that it was America's obligation to
protect the world from the rise of fascism, but truthfully he felt America
should let the Europeans fight their own war. By the end of the evening, he
was able to coax her off her perch and on to the swirling dance floor. She
was happy, more happy than she could remember.  

By the time she got home late that night her mother was asleep. She liked
having the apartment to herself. She sat at the kitchen table and absently
browsed through the day's paper. It felt as if the entire city had finally
gone to bed. The only sound she heard was the tick of the kitchen clock.
Although it was late, she was not ready for sleep. She thought about
Stanley. She replayed their conversation in her head. She pictured herself
dancing. She imagined introducing Stanley to her mother and smiled.

The next day she was late for work. When she arrived she found Zeretski at
his desk with his head in his hands, eyes closed. She knew this as his look
of deep concentration and she left him alone. Suddenly, he looked up at her
and asked, "Is it going to work?" "What?" she said, hoping that he was
referring to some small technical problem and not a more global sense of
pessimism that sometimes overcame him. She was relieved when he asked about
the viability of a protean catalyst that she had been working on. 

She needed to ask him about letting Stanley visit. Two years ago, he would
have enthusiatically put on a show for a class of high school students, but
times had changed. The lack of funds and promise had become harder to
disguise, most notably that that they were the only two remaining employees
in the lab. 

She told him that she had met someone. "Hmm" he said returning his gaze to
his work. She told him that she had met a man that she liked. She realized
that they rarely, if ever, discussed personal matters. She knew that
Zeretski had been married long before she met him and that his wife had
died. But that was about it. She was not quite sure what she expected from
this exchange. He looked up at her from his desk with a expression that
revealed nothing. 

She decided to simply pose her question knowing the answer would be "no."

The next day, she received a message from Stanely asking if she would meet
him for lunch next Saturday at a cafe near her work. She called the number
he had given her and left a message with his answering service agreeing to
the date. She sat in her apartment and imagined meeting never returning.

A few days later, Stanley Mueller was seated in Johnson's office explaining
that he had met the girl, and expected that within the next couple of weeks
he would be able get inside the lab and have time to copy the relevant
documents. Johnson said there was no real rush and that he didn't care to
know the details, but just to let him know when he had the material.

The following Saturday Judith sat across from Stanley at an outdoor cafe.
She asked him about his family and he told her a mix of truth and fiction.
She mentioned her mother but did not say much about her.

During lunch a friend of Stanely's passing the cafe stopped to say hello.
It was an ocupational hazard, but most of his friends knew to be discrete
about his work when running into him in public. The woman was tall and
beautiful. She laid her hand on Stanley's shoulder and laughed with an ease
that Judith envied. After she left, Judith asked, "Who was that?" Stanley
said she was just an old friend from where he used to work. Judith reasured
herself that she was the one having lunch with Stanley.

Stanley again asked her about visiting the lab. She said that Zeretski had
said that he did not want any visitors at this time because he needed to
focus on some important work. Stanley said he understood, but said that it
would exciting just to see the lab where so much had been invented. She
said she would see if that would be possible.

When he got back to his apartment Stanely's girlfriend asked, "So, how was
your date?" in a tone of barely disguised sarcasm. She then added, "I wish
I could be one of your, what do you call them pawns, victims, than maybe I
could get you to take me out." "Okay, Okay" he said, "You knew this was
part of the deal when you met me." "I knew you were a private detective,
but I didn't know that included dating other women." she said. He knew she
was not really angry. She was just using this as a way to gain an advantage
over him, but it irked him just the same. "Do you like her?" she asked.
"She seems smart, I like that." He said. Iris, his girlfriend, had barely
managed to graduate from high school. Iris just looked at him betrying
little emotion. "Okay" he said, "We don't have a lot in common and I find
her a little annoying." He contemplated his own feelings toward Iris.

Iris then smiled and asked, "Is she as good looking as me?" "No" he said
without hesitation. That always worked he thought. You could go on and on
about what kinds of things were important in relationships, but people were
fooling themselves if it ever came down to anything but good looks.

As soon as Judith got home her mother asked her, "How was your date?"
Judith regretted even telling her mother that she was going on a date.
"Fine." she replied. "Did he pay for lunch?" she asked. "Yes." she replied.
Her mother responded with only "hmmm" as if she doubted the veracity of her
answer and asked no more questions.

Judith went to her room and tried to not think about her mother. Her
thoughts turned to Stanley and love. Having little previous experience to
buffer these sorts of feelings, her head was suddenly swimming with
powerful emotions, ike imps from the deep they rose up and grabbed her
pulling her this way and that, and never sitting still long enough for
proper investigation. 

"Love" she thought. And what of her work? What did two mice really prove
except that effects of their tests did not necessiarly result in death?  A
low but important bar in any form of biological research.

Sitting in his small office, Stanley began to consider his options. How
long would it take to get Judith to let him into Zeretski's lab? Johnson
said he was in no rush and he was getting paid, but he did not relish any
case dragging on indefinitely. He decided to play it cool for a while to
see what would happen. Motivating people to do what he wanted was what he
go paid for and he was not bad at his job. 

For a week, Stanley did not call. Anticipation turned to worry and then
worry turned to fear. Each day it became harder for Judith to concentrate
on her work, but work was the only thing that could hold her attention. She
started staying late at work in an effort to minimize the time between
getting home to find no message and going to sleep. Finally she decided to
call him. She left a message with his answering service, and then another. 

The weekend came and she decided she would find him. Maybe something had
happened to him. Why else would he not call? But suddenly she realized how
little she knew about him. The only contact information she had was a
number for his answering service. She did not have an address for where he
lived or worked. She did not know anyone who knew him. The phone directory
gave only the same number she had and no address.

And then her phone rang. She heard his voice. He apologized for not calling
sooner, but said he had been busy with an emergency at work. They agreed to
meet on Sunday afternoon. After she hung up the phone, she felt a sort of
calm so complete it made her wonder if she had ever really felt calm
before. By the next day though, her anxiety had returned. 

The next day she waited for him at the entrance to the park. He arrived a
few minutes late and her anxiety reminded her how little she trusted him
and how little she new him. They walked through the park together and she
asked him questions about his work and life trying build a picture that
placed him in the city.

Stanley sensed her suspicioun. He gave an address for his apartment
building but said he had no phone since he had moved in recently. His
company was not located in the city, but he had a small office on the lower
eastside of Manhattan. His relations had died or lived out of town.

Changing the subject, he told her that he was considering taking classes at
New York University and work toward a degree in science, that she had
inspired him. He said he had no pretentions about becoming a scientist, but
thought at the very least it would help advance his career. 

She knew that he was going to ask again about visiting the lab and she felt
she could no longer keep pretending that a visit was possible. The answer
was no. She decided that she would tell him about their secret work as a
way of explaining why it would be impossible for him to see the lab.
Besides she wanted to talk about it and she did not really understand
Zeretski's desire for secrecy.

"Can you keep a secret?" she asked Stanley. "A secret? What sort of a
secret?" he asked. "Well, it is about my work." "Assuming I even understood
it, who would I possibly tell?" "We have discovered the force the binds
people together." "like us" she stopped short of adding. "Like magnets?" he
asked. It was how it was described to him by the scientist at Jonson and
Franklin. "Yes" she said, "Exactly. Why people are attracted to one another
or repelled." "So, we can forget all about charm and good looks." he
laughed. "Well that certainly makes dating easier." Stanley knew why people
liked each other and why they didn't and it had nothing to do with some
scientific force. The more they talked, the more the whole idea did seem
absurd. They laughed together about the two mice named Helen and Harold.
Judith was surprised by what she was saying and feeling, but she no longer
needed Zeretski.  She had Stanley.

Seated at an outdoor cafe, she told him that visiting the lab was
impossible. After enough time passed so that no connection between the two
events was obvious, Stanley called for the check. He apologized that he
needed to get home early to prepare for an early morning meeting. 

He walked her home. As they stood together outside her apartment, she
leaned forward and gave him a peck on the cheek. He had not expected it. He
smiled as they said goodbye. He did not say he would call her, but knew it
was implied. He would just disappear back into the city. He was sure they
would run into each other again someday. Maybe she would still hate him,
but that was life.   

Just inside the lobby she stopped and turned to watch him from the entrance
as he walked down the street. She smiled as she thought about seeing him
again and then suddenly a wave of panic came over her. She worried that she
would not see him again, that he would disappear again and this time for
good.  She opened the door to call to him, but no sound came out. She
paused trying to make herself go back inside and then she decided to follow
him.

He headed out to a street where he could hail a cab. Standing one block
behind him she hailed just after him. She asked the driver to follow the
cab in front, indentifing the one in which Stanley was riding. The driver
showed no suspicaion at this request. She wondered if this sort of request
was common. She sat back in the seat alone. Stanley one block in front of
her. Out of the cab window she saw couples walking together to catch a late
dinner or show as dusk fell on the city. 

Without even asking her driver pulled to the curb about one block behind
Stanley's cab. She paid the driver and got out. Stanley's cab had stopped
near, but not at the building where Stanley said he lived. She stood a
block behind him as he made a call on pay phone. He then crossed the street
and entered tavern.

Why hadn't he gone home as he said? Maybe he needed to meet someone for
work. All see wanted was to be certain of where he lived. To know of a
place in the city where she could find him. She had come this far. She
would follow him into the tavern. 

Inside it was crowded. She easily found a table where she could see him
without easily being noticed. She ordered a drink. He sat by himself at the
bar and checked his watch. He looked up at the entrance. Less than fifteen
minutes after he had arrived a woman came in and waved to him. He smiled.
She walked over to meet him. He slid off his stool and greeted her with a
kiss. He walked her to a table which was out of view. 

Her mind worked for a rational explanation, some way to put all the pieces
together in a pattern that would fit with the world she had imagined, but
no matter how hard she tried, nothing worked. She left the tavern and
walked the fifteen blocks back to her apartment. As she walked she replayed
the last few weeks in her head from the night when she met Stanley to this
night. 

The next day she could barely focus on her work. The lab looked to her as
shabby as it actually had become. She was angry with Zeretski for not
letting her bring Stanley to the lab. She was sure that letting him visit
the lab with her, as he had asked, would have made a difference. Why did
Zeretski have to become so paranoid? What was she doing here with this
crazy old man anyway?  

She waited for Stanley to call. She had rehersed many times in her head
their conversation. He would ask her out again and she would tell him that
she was no longer interested, that she had found someone else. But he never
called. 

Her mother knew something was wrong. Arriving home a few days after their
last date, her mother asked, "So, are you planning to go out again next
weekend with Stanley?" "No" she said as causally as she could muster. "Oh"
her mother said feigning surprise, "and why not?" "I don't know, mother"
she shouted. "Well, I am not surprised. That is what men are like. It is
better you find out now. They only want the glamore girls. Not girls like
us." To her mother the whole episode has been a mistake, a disruption in
the normal state of affairs that was finally put back to right. She wanted
to really shout. She wanted to scream. She wanted to smash everything
around her.

On Friday evening, she called Stanley's answering service and left a
message that she had convinced Zeretski to let her take him to the lab.
Saturday morning he called her, again apologizing for not calling sooner.
The agreed to meet for dinner that night and then she would take him to the
lab.

They arrived at the entrance to the building which still resembled the
warehouse that it once was. The entrance was up a short flight of concrete
stairs leading to a heavy metal door. The door was cast in an unearthy
light by a single gas-discharge lamp that emitted a constant buzz. A man as
important as Zeretski, did not have time to bother with impression. 

She lead him through a series of rooms that mostly contained workbenches in
addition to shops and libraries. On top of the benches were glass flasks
and tubes and wires and metal boxes with dials and meters and panels of
switches. The equipment was impressive, like nothing he had ever seen
before except maybe as a drawing in a comic book, though much of it looked
like it had not been used in years. 

The building was such a warren of rooms and staircases. Stanley
was worried he would have a hard time finding his way out.

As they toured the building, Judith explained all of the scientific work
that had been completed there and her role in it. She wanted him to know
what she had spent the past nine years of her life working on. She wanted
him to know everything she had discovered and invented and the importance
of her work. 

They finally came to a room larger than all of the others. The space was
almost two stories high and generally round in shape. Much of the walls
were covered in large electrical cables some as thick as his thigh.
Distributed around the upper story were what looked like gray electrical
transformer boxes giving the impression that whatever went on in here, it
needed a lot of power. 

In the middle of the room was a large apparatus that appeared to be the
focal point of all the machinery that surrounded it. The machine extended
about half way down from the ceiling and stopped. 

The room was quiet except for the slight buzzing of the overhead lights.
On one wall was a large control panel that contained rows of levers,
switches and dials. Judith walked toward the panel and threw what looked
like a master switch. The entire room came alive with the whir of motors
and the hum of electricity. Sets of red and yellow lights illuminated and
the needles on dials moved to indicate life.  

Stanley stood in awe of all he did not understand. She guided him toward
the center of the room. Suddenly he felt a sharp prick in his thigh. She
looked directly at him, her eyes wide, he saw her hand holding a syringe.
He moved his hand to grab her wrist and stop her, but he found he had no
strength. His legs could no longer carry his weight and he fell back into a
chair. He sat unable to move his limbs. 

He tried to make sense of what was happening. Was she trying to kill him?
He had never killed anyone himself, but he knew of people who dealt with
problems this way. But what was the problem? How could she possibly know
why he was there? He asked, "What are you doing?" She did not answer him. 

Desperate he asked, "Why are you doing this?" But again she did not answer
him or even look at him. He pleaded, "I love you." "No." she said, "You
don't." and stopped short of saying "you will", fearing a jinx or failure,
as she moved him in his chair toward the middle of the room.

Suddenly it dawned on him what was happening. But this was maddness. It was
an idea so absurd that they had both laughed about it over dinner. How
could she be taking this seriously. But here it was real and happening to
him.

She sat down next to him and waited staring straight ahead.

"Don't do it." he shouted to her. "Why?" she said calmly not turning her
gaze. "Because I don't love you. I don't even like you." he pleaded. "But
you will." she said. "But it won't be real." "How do you know what is
real?" And then there was blinding flash of light.
