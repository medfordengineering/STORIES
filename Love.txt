Only fifteen minutes into his lecture, Professor Zeretski had already
filled most of the blackboard with equations. After writing each equation,
he turned to his audience and tapped the board with his chalk as if to
emphasize that numbers, more than words, could be relied on to carry truth.
But the truth was that his latest discovery sounded outlandish, maybe too
outlandish, when described in plain English.

His audience, six men and one woman, were sitting around a long and
expensive conference table in a room far above the streets of Manhattan.
Through the windows it was possible to see, far below, people wrapped in
fall attire making their way silently and with haste toward another day of
work, but none of this had the attention of the people around the table. 

The blackboard, out of place in the room, had been brought in for
Zeretski's presentation. No one had spoken since he began his lecture, but
the patience of the men around the table was beginning to wear as they
started looking at each other with glances that confided how little they
understood of what he was saying.

The one woman in the room was the professor's lab assistant, Judith Kitts,
a woman in her early 30s who had worked for him for almost a decade. She
was the reason he was here and arranging this meeting had not been easy,
but the professor needed money and these were the sort of people who could
give it to him. 

Finally, Mr. Jonson, one of the older gentlemen at the table, cleared his
throat and interrupting Zeretski said, "Professor, with the likely
exception of Ms. Kitts, we have only the vaguest notion of what you are
talking about. Do you think you could explain your latest discovery in
less..well...less scientific terms?"

Professor Zeretski paused for a moment and stared out the window as if
something else had caught his attention. He then turned back to look
directly at Jonson and said, "I have discovered love." "Love?" said Jonson.
"Love?" thought Judith. Well, that was certainly an exaggeration, but at
least he had their attention. 

"My dear professor, I do hope you have not come here just to tell us that
you have fallen in love." "No, No" smiled the professor as if he were in on
the joke. "I have discovered the force of attraction between humans. Not
only have I discovered what causes this attraction. I know how to make it
happen."

"Are you saying you know how to make people fall in love?" Said Mr.
Franklin, who together with Jonson, directed the investment firm of
Franklin and Jonson.  "Not love exactly. I have discovered the force of
attraction that exists between people, what makes them close friends or
mortal enemies. Just like the fundamental forces of gravity or magnetism,
human attraction is a quantifiable force that can pull people together or
push them apart." 

"Maybe you can help Halpern here" said one of the younger men at the table,
gesturing toward the man sitting next to him. "He's been chatting up the
barmaid at The Four Horses for weeks now and she still won't give him the
time of day."

"Then scientifically speaking, there is no attraction between them." said
Zeretski. "Oh, I wouldn't say that. Poor Halpern is half mad for the young
lady, and with good reason, I might add." Halpern tired to smile, but was
not entirely comfortable with this discussion of his personal life.

"No" responded the professor shaking his head. "Young Halpern is no more
attracted to the barmaid than this a wooden chair could feel an attraction
to the most powerful magnet on earth. The attraction between humans" he
continued, "behaves like any other force. It must be mutual."

Zeretski then lifted a glass of water off the table and held it above the
floor. "While it is easy imagine the massive Earth pulling the tiny glass,
it is harder to imagine the tiny glass pulling the massive Earth. But the
fact is that the attraction and between the two objects is the same."
Dropping the glass on the carpeted floor, he said, "The only reason the
Earth moves so little is simply its size."

As the glass lay on the floor, he addressed Halpern directly "You feel like
you are supposed to like this barmaid and so you invent an artificial
sense of attraction where none exists." The room was silent for a moment as
everyone around the table contemplated their own relationships with wives,
friends and family.

Judith considered her own life. What did she really know about love? Her
knowledge of the subject came mostly from novels, movies and the
confidences of her few friends. 

The conversation turned to the status of Zeretski's discovery, specifically
what proof he had for his claims. Zeretski confessed that, to date, his
only experiments had been with animals, to be precise two mice which he
revealed were named Harold and Helen. The names were Judith's suggestion,
taken from a novel she had been reading at the time and a suggestion she
now regretted.

The tone of the meeting shifted again with the gentlemen poking subtle fun
at the notion of two mice in love. Judith understood their skepticism, but
not their lack of respect for a man who had won the Nobel Prize for physics
at the age of 28. Men who had nothing to show for their work but their
money. 

Zeretski had submitted his first paper to the Journal of Physics when he
was only sixteen and a student at the University of Budapest.  Shortly
after, he was recruited to Princeton University where he completed his
Nobel prize winning work on electronic transfer, which had led to the low
cost electrification of cities and towns throughout the country.

By his mid-thirties, he was a well known public figure and a highly prized
guest at society events. His advise was sought by heads of industry and
even the President of the United States.

With substantial financial backing, he built a large laboratory in the
warehouse district of Manhattan with a staff which at its peak numbered 34.
Over time, his work produced some moderately successful discoveries but
nothing that seemed to live up to the moniker "The Great Zeretski", as he
been dubbed in the papers and a title he showed no embarrassment in
hearing.  

Zeretski wanted to press diamonds from coal, move matter through space, and
power cities with bolts of lightning, "harness the very heavens themselves"
as he was quoted as saying. It was unclear what drove him as he had no
serious rivals in his field, but it was clear that his failures did nothing
to dampened his ambition.

When there was nothing substantial to show for his work, he took to giving
garish demonstrations that often included showers of sparks and plumes of
smoke, demonstrations that bordered on theater. Over time he gained the
reputation as a mad scientist and he played the part well. 

It got to the point that Judith sometimes wondered if Zeretski himself
could distinguish what was real from what was make believe or that, maybe
in desperation, he believed he might conjure real science from well crafted
theater. But Judith was convinced that his most recent work, their work,
was quite real.

After the meeting, Jonson and Franklin met privately in Jonson's office.
"What do you think of Zeretski's claims?" asked Jonson. "It is either the
most important discovery of our century or just another one of his crackpot
ideas." said Franklin.  "Mice." Jonson mused to himself as he leaned back
in his chair "What sort of proof are mice?" "If we could get a scientist we
trust to listen to his claims, we might be in a better position to judge."
said Franklin. "Not likely" said Jonson launching forward in is chair. "He
is completely paranoid. I guess I did not mention that he would only allow
members of the firm at the meeting." "Then what was he doing with all those
equations and scientific jargon in front of a group of bankers?" asked
Franklin. "Hard to say, but how else do you really explain his sort of
work?" 

"The question is, is it worth trying to find out more?" asked Jonson "If
we could get a scientist that we trust to review his research, we would
be in a better position to make a decision." responded Franklin.  "But I
guess he is not likely to hand it over to us." Franklin added.  "What do
you think about bringing in Mueller?" asked Jonson. "I think it makes
sense. I'll give him a call."

Stanley Mueller was listed under private detectives in the Yellow Pages
but only because there was no heading for criminal. To be fair, he did
investigative work, but his work often and intentionally crossed legal
boundaries. 

Stanley was both tough and handsome and was equally comfortable using
either of these assets to get what he wanted. He bore no particular malice
toward the world or anyone in it, he just liked to get things done.

He had grown up in the city, dropped out before finishing high school and
moved from a life on the streets to his present occupation. His initial
employment had mostly been as a thug working for various mob bosses, but he
was reasonably smart and had a reputation for working discretely.  Through a
series of chance meetings he had been introduced to a class of gentlemen,
though not defined as criminals, were willing to employ his sort of help
once in a while. 

As a result, he made a decent living. In his mid-thirties, he lived alone
dating a series of women until each one realized that the present state of
Stanley Mueller would bare little difference to the future state of Stanley
Mueller. The only ticking clock he heard in his head was the one marching
him steadily through life.

After Stanley's meeting with Franklin and Jonson, he arrived back at his
apartment to find a note from his present girlfriend letting him know that
she was out for the afternoon, but would be back with dinner. Immediately,
he regretted giving her a key his apartment. He was getting soft in his old
age he chuckled to himself. He looked in his fridge for lunch, but there
were few reasonable candidates. He had to admit that having a regular and
decent meal might be a life improvement. 

He headed out to local diner and sat thinking about his new contract. It
seemed straight forward enough, find and copy information about an
invention that dealt with some sort of force that existed between humans.
The idea seemed kinda crazy, but who was he to judge. The hardest part
seemed to be how to find the specific information his clients needed, but
there had been a scientist at the meeting who had apparently worked with
Zeretski in the past and let him know exactly what he should look for and a
good idea as to where to find it. Still, how would he be sure what was
important and what was not? He would worry about that latter. For now, he
just had to figure out how to get in to Zeretski's lab.

That evening after the meeting, Judith sat in the kitchen of the apartment
she shared with her mother reading the society section of the paper.
Following the trials and tribulations of the locally famous was a guilty
pleasure.  Her mother sat across from her and talked to her about her day
which usually included shopping and some complaint about the butcher or the
grocer or someone who passed her too closely in the street, perceived daily
slights that served to punctuate and confirm her existence. Judith
responded with nods and "hmmms" which her mother took as affirmation. The
truth was that Judith could not stand her mother's life and often imagined
the day when she would leave.

Before falling asleep that night, she thought about the day and felt
slightly optimistic. Although the meeting did not go was well as she had
hoped the bankers had listened, showed genuine interest and promised to get
back to them with a plan. But experience told her that optimism was often
followed by doubt. For the past few years and maybe her whole life, she
really could not remember, her emotional state seemed to vacillate between
these two extremes. But instead of resulting in a zero sum, these
contrasting forces seemed to reinforce each other, always pushing her
forward like the swing of a pendulum drives the hand of a clock.

Two weeks after the meeting, Judith was seated at the bar of the San Marco.
The San Marco was a small but lively club with a jazz band that played a
few nights a week. In front of the band was a dance floor surrounded by
intimate candle-lit tables complete with well-dressed couples in neatly
pressed attire that both shined and sparkled. The crowd talked, laughed,
drank and smoked and by early evening spilled onto the dance floor
propelled toward chaos by their collective nervous tension and held in
check only by the steady rhythm of the music.

She had started going there with a friend after work, but over time her
friend had lost interest. Judith continued going in the hope that she might
meet someone, but the only men who washed up on the barstool next to her
were too old, too shabby or too drunk. Still it was better than being home.
She often passed the time reading a novel and having a light meal.

Judith sat her usual spot at the end of the bar which was set against back
wall of the club and separated from the tables and dance floor by a row of
booths. The bartender usually greeted her when she arrived her, but mostly
left her alone.

That evening the club felt more crowded than usual. A few minutes after she
sat down, she heard the man sitting next to her ask if he could buy her a
drink.  Her initial instinct was to get up and leave. The last couple of
weeks at work had been stressful. The mere prospect of financial salvation
cast a sharp contrast against the certainty of their financial predicament
making it all the less bearable. She could not imagine her life without
Zeretski and the lab and she was not in the mood for another
disappointment.

But she was enjoying her book and did not want to go home. Without looking
up she said "No thank you", and waited for the bartender to find her. The
man then asked her what she was reading. Barely turning her head she named
the title of the book and the author. 

"Say, do you think that is Hadley Mason?" the man said, pointing in the
direction of a gentleman seated on the other side of the bar and who looked
nothing like Hadley Mason, a recent sensation on Broadway.

She turned to follow the direction of the man's finger and then realizing
the farce turned further to find to a handsome face, far more handsome than
belonged in her section of the bar. For a moment, she was taken aback. She
thought that maybe he was lost, mistakenly flung from the crowd and not
quite realizing where he had landed. 

Cute boys had talked with her before, but only in high school and only to
tease her. One would approach her and start to flirt and she would imagine
that he, unlike the others, had seen through her quiet exterior to the
person that she knew she could be. But then he would break out in a laugh
unable to contain himself and joined by his friends. The humor captured in
the absurdity of the proposal. It was in this way that she learned the
limits of her physical attraction. A far more accurate reflection than any
mirror could provide.

But he was no high school student and there were no friends waiting in the
wings for the joke to unfold. 

Completing the joke he squinted into the distance and said, "Well, on
second thought, I guess my doctor is right, I do need glasses." She smiled.
"My name is Stanley" he said holding out his hand.  He always gave his real
name. He found that false names posed more of a hazard. 

After a short time, he steered the conversation to her work. She told him
she worked for Walter Zeretski. "Wow, The Great Zeretski?" he exclaimed,
"Is he really..." he paused to judge her reaction. "He is quite a
character." she admitted. "I don't tell too many people this," he said,
"but as a kid, he was my hero.  I wanted to be a scientist, but couldn't
afford college." adding that he had to settle for being a salesman for a
large electronics manufacturer.  

"What is he working on now?" he asked. She wanted to tell him about their
latest work, their theory about the forces that bind people together, but
Zeretski had made her swear to reveal nothing. Unlike previous discoveries
he treated this one more seriously, though she was unsure if he was more
afraid of losing it to theft or scrutiny?

"Oh you know, he is still trying to harness the very heavens." She said and
talked about his efforts to store the energy from bolts of lightning.

"I used to try to read his books, but could never understand a thing." he
confessed, "but I thought that at least I looked smart" he laughed. As he
spoke he wondered if there was any truth to what he was saying. Making up
stories about his past came so easily to him, he sometimes wondered, could
it all be fiction? Maybe, as a kid he did want to be a scientist. 

He asked if it would be possible to meet Zeretski and get a tour of the
lab. She promised she would ask. He felt he had gotten as far as he could
without raising suspicion and turned the conversation to the war in Europe,
a topic that was increasingly hard to ignore. He agreed with her that it
was America's obligation to protect the world from the rise of fascism, but
truthfully he felt America should let the Europeans fight their own war. By
the end of the evening, he was able to coax her off her perch and on to the
dance floor where finding her place among the swirling couples she felt
awkward and beautiful.

By the time she got home late that night her mother was asleep. She liked
having the apartment to herself. She sat at the kitchen table and absently
browsed through the day's paper. It felt as if the entire city had finally
gone to bed. The only sound she heard was the tick of the kitchen clock.
Although it was late, she was not ready for sleep. She thought about
Stanley. She replayed bits of their conversation in her head. She pictured
herself dancing. She imagined introducing Stanley to her mother and smiled.

The next day she was late for work. When she arrived she found Zeretski at
his desk with his head in his hands, eyes closed. She knew this as his look
of deep concentration and she left him alone. Hearing her pass behind him,
he looked up at her and asked, "Is it going to work?" "What?" she said,
hoping that he was referring to some small technical problem and not a more
global sense of pessimism that sometimes overcame him. She was relieved
when he asked about the viability of a protean catalyst that she had been
working on. 

As usual his concern was overstated and after their discussion she
decided to ask him about Stanley visiting the lab. Two years ago, he
would have enthusiastically put on a show for a class of high school
students, but times had changed. The lack of funds and success had
become harder to disguise, most notably that they were the only two
remaining employees in the lab. 

She told him that she had met someone. "Hmm" he said returning his gaze to
his work. She told him that she had met a man that she liked. The
conversation felt awkward since Zeretski was not the kind of person that
seemed inclined to talk about personal matters. She barely knew anything
about his personal life except that he had been married long before she met
him and that his wife had died. He looked up at her from his desk with a
expression that revealed nothing. 

She decided to simply pose her question knowing the answer would be "no."

The next day, she received a message from Stanely asking if she would meet
him for lunch next Saturday at a cafe near her work. She called the number
he had given her and left a message with his answering service agreeing to
the date. As she sat in her apartment, she imagined meeting Stanley for
lunch and never returning.

A few days later, Stanley Mueller was seated in Johnson's office explaining
that he had met the girl, and expected that within the next couple of weeks
he would be able get inside the lab and have time to copy the relevant
documents. Johnson said there was no real rush and that he didn't care to
know the details, but just to let him know when he had the material.

The following Saturday Judith sat across from Stanley at an outdoor cafe.
She asked him about his family and he told her a mix of truth and fiction.
She mentioned that she lived with her mother but did not say much about her.

During lunch a friend of Stanely's passing the cafe stopped to say hello.
It was an occupational hazard, but most of his friends knew to be discrete
about his work when running into him in public. The woman was tall and
beautiful. She laid her hand on Stanley's shoulder and laughed with the
kind of ease that Judith envied. After she left, Judith asked, "Who was
that?" Stanley said she was just an old friend from where he used to work.
Judith reassured herself that she was the one having lunch with Stanley.

Stanley again asked her about meeting Zeretski. She had hoped that he had
forgotten about this request. She told him that Zeretski had said that he
was too busy with important work to host visitors at the moment. Stanley
said he understood, but added that he would be interested in just seeing
the lab even if he could not meet with Zeretski. She said she would see if
that would be possible.

When he got back to his apartment Stanely's girlfriend asked, "So, how was
your date?" in a tone of barely disguised sarcasm. She then added, "I wish
I could be one of your, what do you call them pawns, victims, than maybe I
could get you to take me out." "Okay, Okay" he said, "You knew this was
part of the deal when you met me." "I knew you were a private detective,
but I didn't know that included dating other women." she said. He knew she
was not really angry. She was just using this as a way to gain an advantage
over him, but it irked him just the same. "Do you like her?" she asked.
"She seems smart. I like that." He said. Iris, his girlfriend, had barely
managed to graduate from high school. Iris just looked at him betraying
little emotion. "Okay, we don't have a lot in common and I find her a
little annoying." He said truthfully but also wondering how he felt about
Iris.

Iris then smiled and asked, "Is she as good looking as me?" "No" he said
without hesitation. That always worked he thought. You could go on and on
about what kinds of things were important in relationships, but people were
fooling themselves if it ever came down to anything but good looks.

As soon as Judith got home her mother asked her, "How was your date?"
Judith regretted even telling her mother that she was going on a date.
"Fine." she replied. "Did he pay for lunch?" she asked. "Yes." she replied.
Her mother responded with only "hmmm". Not sure if she believed the answer.

Judith went to her room and tried to not think about her mother. She lay on
her bed and thought about Stanley. Her head swam with powerful emotions,
like imps from the deep they rose up and grabbed her pulling her this way
and that, and never sitting still long enough for proper investigation. Was
this love? Did her feelings for Stanley correlate with a scientific
explanation? Did it matter? What did two mice really prove except that
effects of their tests did not necessarily result in mammalian death? A low
but necessary bar in any form of biological research.

Sitting in his small office, Stanley assessed his options. How long would
it take for him to get Judith to let him into Zeretski's lab? Johnson said
he was in no rush, but he did not relish any case dragging on indefinitely.
One the plus side, he was getting paid. He decided to play it cool with
Judith to see if that would move things along more quickly.

For a week, Stanley did not call. Anticipation turned to worry and then
worry turned to fear. Each day it became harder for Judith to concentrate
on her work, but work was the only thing that could hold her attention. She
started staying late at the lab in an effort to minimize the time between
getting home to find no message from him and releasing herself to sleep.
Finally she decided to call him. She left a message with his answering
service, and then another. 

The weekend came and she began to worry that maybe something had happened
to him. Why else would he not call? She decided that she needed to find him
but how? Suddenly she realized how little she knew about him. The only
contact information she had was a number for his answering service. She did
not have an address for where he lived or worked. She did not know anyone
who knew him. Consulting the phone directory gave only the same number and
no address listed.

And then her phone rang. She heard his voice. He apologized for not calling
sooner, but said he had been busy with an emergency at work. They agreed to
meet on Sunday afternoon. The conversation lasted less than a minute.
After she hung up the phone, she felt overcome by a wave of calmness so
complete it made her wonder if she had ever really felt calm before. By the
next morning though she could feel her usual level of anxiety returning.

That afternoon she waited for Stanley at the entrance to the park. She
checked her watch. He was a few minutes late. She felt panic and wondered
how she could have let herself become so vulnerable. Then, relieved, she
saw him emerge from the crowd of strangers. They walked through the park
together. She asked him questions about his work and his life trying to
find reference points that she could use to place him in the city to frame
him in her world in a way that he could never again disappear.

Stanley sensed her suspicion. He gave an address for his apartment building
but said he had no phone since he had moved in recently. The company he
worked for was not located in the city, but he had a small office on the
Lower Eastside of Manhattan. His relations had either died or lived out of
town.

Changing the subject, he told her that he was considering taking classes at
New York University and working toward a degree in science and that she had
inspired him. He said he had no pretensions about becoming a scientist, but
thought at the very least it would help advance his career. 

She could tell he was going to ask again about visiting the lab again and
she felt she could no longer keep pretending that a visit was possible. 

She had decided that she would tell him about their recent work. Maybe if
he knew how important it was, he would understand the need for secrecy.
Besides she wanted to talk about her work with Stanley, with anyone. How
could Stanley Muller, an electronics salesman could pose any danger?

When there was a lull in the conversation she asked him "Can you keep a
secret?" "A secret? Well it depends on what sort of secret?" he smiled not
knowing if this was just some sort of game she was playing.  "It is about
my work." she said seriously. "Well, assuming I even understood it, who
would I possibly tell?" he laughed. She stopped and turned to face him and
said "This is serious. You really do have to promise." "Okay, I promise."
he said.

She turned and they continued walking side by side. For a few minutes,
neither of them spoke. "We, professor Zeretski and I, have discovered a new
force, the force the binds people together." she said "I don't understand."
he acted confused, but the truth was he had never really understood the
idea when it was first explained to him.

"Like magnets." she said and went on to describe the idea in as straight
forward a manner as possible. "So, we can forget all about charm and good
looks." he laughed. "Well that certainly makes dating easier." 

Stanley knew why people liked each other and why they didn't and it had
nothing to do with some scientific force. Judith had never described the
idea much less talked about it with anyone but Zeretski and it did begin
sound kind of outlandish the more she described it. She was surprised to
find herself laughing with him about the two mice named Helen and Harold,
but maybe her work no longer mattered. Maybe it was only Stanley that
really mattered.

Seated at an outdoor cafe, she told him that Zeretski had become paranoid
about this new project and that he was adamant about not allowing visitors.
There would be no way she could get him into the lab. Stanley smiled and
said that of course he understood and changed the topic. After enough time
passed so that no connection between the two events was obvious, Stanley
called for the check. He apologized that he needed to get home early to
prepare for an early morning meeting. 

He offered to walk her home though only because his guilty conscious had
got the better of him. As they stood together outside her apartment, she
leaned forward and gave him a peck on the cheek. He had not expected it
though it did not seem out of place. He smiled and said goodbye. He did not
say he would call her, but knew it was implied. The truth was that he would
disappear back into the city, impossible to find except by chance. Someday,
who knew when, he would run into her again and maybe she would still hate
him, but that was life.   

Just inside the lobby door of her apartment she stopped and turned. She
watched him through the entrance window as he walked down the street. She
smiled as she thought about seeing him again and then, as he continued to
move away, a wave of panic came over her. What if he did not call again?
What if he was truly disappearing down the street for good? She opened the
door to call to him, but could not bring her voice above a whisper. She
paused holding herself in the doorway and then decided to follow him.

He headed out to a main street where he could hail a cab. Standing one
block behind him she hailed a cab just behind his. She asked the driver to
follow the cab, identifying the one in which Stanley was riding. The driver
showed no surprise at her request and she wondered how often this sort of
thing happened. Out of the window the world seemed normal. She saw couples
walking together to catch a late dinner, to see a show or maybe just out
for an evening stroll as dusk fell on the city. 

Without even asking, her driver pulled to the curb about one block behind
Stanley's cab. She paid the fair and got out. Stanley's cab had stopped
about a block from the building where he said he lived. She watched as he
made a call on a pay phone. He then crossed the street and entered a
tavern.

She wondered why he hadn't gone home as he said? She was sure there was an
explanation, but she had come this far and all she needed was to be certain
of where he lived. To know of the place in the city where she could find
him. She decided to follow him just until he went home.  

Inside the tavern was crowded, and she was able to find a table where she
could see him without being noticed. She ordered a drink.  He sat by
himself at the bar and checked his watch. He looked up at the entrance.
Less than fifteen minutes after he had arrived a woman came in and waved to
him. He smiled. She walked over to meet him. He slid off his stool and
greeted her with a kiss. He walked her to a table which was out of view. 

Her mind worked for a rational explanation, some way to put all the pieces
together in a pattern that would fit with the world that had, until now,
seemed quite real, but no matter how hard she tried, nothing worked.
Sitting at her table now alone, she watched as the crowd around her
continued to drink and shout like actors on stage, going "on with the show"
as if nothing had happened. It made her feel that either she or they did
not truly exist.

She paid her bill and left. She walked down the street, leaving the tavern
behind her and then continued to walk the fifteen blocks back to her
apartment. As she walked she replayed over and over every detail of the
last few weeks in her head from the night they met, trying to find where
the story had gone so horribly wrong. 

The next day she could barely focus on her work. The lab now looked to her
as shabby as it actually had become. She was angry with Zeretski for not
letting her bring Stanley to the lab. She was sure that if she had let him
visit the lab with her, things would be different. Why was he so stubborn?
Why was he so paranoid? Why did she listen to him and what was she doing
here anyway, spending her days with a crazy old man who thought he could
change the universe.

For a week, she waited for Stanley to call. Why didn't he call? He had not
seen her following him. He did not know what she knew. She imagined and
rehearsed their conversation many times in her head. He would ask her out
again and she would tell him that she was no longer interested and that she
had found someone else. But he never called. He never gave her the chance.

Her mother, knowing something was wrong, asked, "So, are you planning to go
out again next weekend with Stanley?" "No" she said as causally as she
could muster. "Oh" her mother said feigning surprise, "why not?" "I don't
know, mother" she said with less restraint and with tears welling behind
her eyes. "Well, I am not surprised" her mother said shaking her head. "I
always told you that is what men are like. It is better you find out now.
They only want the glamorous ones. Not girls like us." To her mother the
whole episode had been a mistake, a disruption in the normal state of
affairs that was finally put back to right. Judith wanted to shout. She
wanted to scream.  She wanted to smash everything around her. But instead
she just went to her room and cried.

On Friday evening, she called Stanley's answering service and left a
message that Zeretski had changed his mind. She could take him on a tour of
the lab. Saturday morning Stanley returned her call, again apologizing for
not calling sooner. They agreed to meet for dinner that night.

After dinner, they arrived at the entrance to Zeretski's laboratory which
from the outside still resembled the warehouse that it once was. The
entrance was up a short flight of concrete stairs leading to a heavy metal
door. It was lit by a single gas-discharge lamp that emitted a constant
heavy buzz and cast a pale greenish glow. It gave the impression that the
great Zeretski was far too serious to bother with the mundane details of
appearance or that behind these doors lurked the lair of a mad scientist.

Inside, Judith guided him through room after room where rows of lab benches
stood covered with glass flasks and tubes and wires and metal boxes with
dials and meters and panels of switches. The equipment was impressive, like
nothing Stanley had ever seen before except maybe in a comic book or the
movies, though much of it looked dusty and stale like it had not been used
in years. 

Judith showed him where first worked as a lab assistant helping to develop
an improved process for manufacturing battery cells. Although she was just
the youngest assistant on a five person team, their work was successful and
her dedication to working long hours caught the eye of Zeretski. She showed
him where she and designed a metal composite that could be used to store
charge more efficiently then previous techniques. For this work she was
awarded a patent and listed as co-inventor along with two colleagues. From
there she went on to lead a small team working on high temperature
insulators. Judith was determined to walk him through every detail of her
scientific work over the past nine years. She was in no hurry and she did
not care how much of the details he understood.

Stanley tried to follow what she was saying but was mainly worried, that
the building was such a warren of rooms and staircases, he would have a
hard time finding his way out.

Finally they came to a room far larger than all of the others. The space
was almost two stories high and generally round in shape. Above door height
the walls snaked with large electrical cables some of which looked as thick
as Stanley's thigh. The wires feed into a series of large grey cylinders
also distributed around the upper story and giving the impression that
whatever went on in here, it needed a lot of power. It was also one of the
few rooms in the building that appeared to have recent usage. 

In the middle of the room was a large contraption that appeared to be the
focal point of everything that surrounded it. The machine extended
about half way down from the ceiling ending in twin turrets each with a
barrel that could be focused on any point in the room.

The room was quiet except for the slight buzzing of the overhead lights.
On one wall was a large control panel that contained rows of levers beneath
a grid of dials and lights. Judith walked to the panel and threw one of the
levers. The entire room came alive with a whir of motors and a hum of
electricity. On the panel, red and yellow lights illuminated and the
needles on dials moved to indicate life. 

She guided him toward the center of the room where a small wooden table and
two wooden chairs had been placed. They looked alien in a room where nature seemed
to have no place. On the table where two wine glasses already filled and a
bottle of wine. Stanley stared, did she really think she would seduce him
in the middle of this strange laboratory? Well, the wine would play to his
advantage. Getting her drunk would make his job a lot easier. He actually
wondered why he did not think of it himself.

He smiled at Judith and said, "Looks like you were expecting company." She
smiled and let him pull out the chair for her. They picked up their glasses
and he said "Cheers." He then finished his glass quickly, hoping to
encourage her to do the same. 

He was puzzled by her silence and the curious sort of smile that appeared
on her face and that he had not seen before. He began to suggest they have
another glass, when he noticed his arms and legs felt heavy, like a weight
had descended over his entire body. He could not move. "Damn" he thought,
"How could he fallen for this?" 

Slurring his words he said "I think there was something in my drink."
Judith just smiled taking another sip and said, "Mine tastes fine." He
tried to make sense of what was happening. Was she going to kill him?  He
had never killed anyone himself, but he knew of people who dealt with
problems this way. But what problem was she dealing with? And how could she
possibly know why he was there? "What are you doing?" he asked, but she did
not answer him. 

She got up from her chair and walked to the control panel. Desperate he
asked, "Why are you doing this?" But again she gave no answer nor did she
even look at him. He pleaded, "I love you." "No." she said firmly as she
worked dials and levers on a control panel "You don't." 

The two turrets in center of the room came to life and each of their
barrels pointed directly at one of the two chairs. A beam of light painted
a white circle on the center of Stanley's chest. 

She released a lever and a large neon counter illuminated and began to
count back from five. Making her way back to the second chair, it finally
dawned on him what was happening. But this was madness. It was an idea so
absurd that they had both laughed about it over dinner. How could she be
taking this seriously. But now it was real and it was happening to him.

She sat down in the chair across from him and looked at him with a sort of
pity in her eyes. "Don't do it." he shouted to her, "Please!". "Why?" she
smiled. "Because...because, I don't love you. I don't even like you." he
pleaded. "But you will." she said. "But it won't be real." "How do you know
what is real?" And then the neon counter reached zero and there was
blinding flash of light.
