As Professor Zeretski described his new discovery he wrote equations on the
blackboard. Each equation punctuated a point in his argument and each point
was emphasized by his tapping the board with his chalk as if numbers, more
than words, could be relied on to carry truth. But the truth was that his
latest discovery sounded outlandish, maybe too outlandish, when described
in plain English.

His audience, six men and one woman, were sitting around a large and
expensive conference table in a room with a view looking out from the
Manhattan skyline.  The blackboard, out of place in the room, had been
brought in for his presentation. No one had spoken since he began his
lecture, but their patience was clearly beginning to wear as they started
looking at each other with glances that confided how little they understood
of what he was saying.

The one woman in the room was the professor's lab assistant, Judith Kitts.  A
woman in her early 30s who had worked for him since she was a teenager. She
was the reason he was here. The professor needed money and she knew these were
the people who could give it to him. 

Finally, Mr. Jonson, one of the older gentlemen at the table, cleared his
throat and interrupting Zeretski said, "Professor, with the likely exception of
Ms. Kitts, we have only the vaguest notion of what you are talking about. Do
you think you could explain your latest discovery in less scientific terms?"

Professor Zeretski paused for a moment and stared out the window as if
something else had caught his attention. He then turned back to look at
Jonson and said, "I have discovered love." "Love?" said Jonson.  Love
thought Judith.  Well that was certainly laying it plain. At least he now
had their attention.

"My dear professor, I do hope you have not come here just to tell us that
you have fallen in love." "No, No" replied the professor as if he were in
on the joke. "I have discovered the force of attraction between humans. Not
only have I discovered what causes this attraction. I know how to make it
happen."

"Are you saying you know how to make people fall in love?" Said Mr. Franklin,
who together with Jonson, directed the investment firm of Franklin and Jonson.
"Not love precisely. I have discovered the force of attraction between people,
what makes them close friends or mortal enemies. Like the fundamental forces of
gravity or magnetism, human attraction is a quantifiable force that can pull
people together or push them apart." 

"Maybe you can help Halpern here" said one of the younger men at the table,
gesturing toward the man sitting next to him. "He's been chatting up the bar
maid at Pete's Pub for weeks now and she still won't give him the time of day."

"Then scientifically speaking, there is no attraction between them." said
Zeretski.  "Oh, I wouldn't say that. Poor Halpern is half mad for the young
lady, and with good reason, I might add." Halpern tired to smile, but was
not entirely comfortable with this discussion of his personal life.

"No" responded the professor shaking his head. "Young Halpern is no more
attracted to the bar maid than this a wooden chair could feel an attraction
to the most powerful magnet on earth. The attraction between humans" he
continued, "behaves like any other force. It must be mutual."

Zeretski lifted a glass of water off the table and held it above the floor.
"While it is easy imagine the massive Earth pulling the tiny glass, it is
harder to imagine the tiny glass pulling the massive Earth. But the fact is
that the attraction and between the two objects is the same." Dropping the
glass on the carpeted floor, he said, "The only reason the Earth moves so
little is simply its size."

As the glass lay on the floor, he addressed Halpern directly "You feel
like you are supposed to like this bar maid and so you invent an
artificial sense of attraction where none exists." The room was silent for
a moment as the men contemplated their own relationships with wives,
friends and family.

But it was love, thought Judith, that he had discovered. Although love was
something with which she had little direct experience. Her knowledge of the
subject came mostly from books and movies and the confidences of her few
friends.  Her father, a man devoted to his own scientific work, had gotten
her the job in Zeretski's lab before he died and before she finished high
school. Since then she had devoted herself to his work.

The conversation turned to the status of Zeretski's discovery and what proof he
had for his claims. Zeretski confessed that, to date, his only experiments had
been with animals --to be precise two mice named Harold and Helen. 

The tone of the meeting shifted again with the gentlemen now poking fun at
the notion of two mice in love. Judith understood their skepticism, but
felt angry that they could show so little respect for a man who had won the
Nobel Prize for physics at the age of 28. Men whose only work she felt
amounted to nothing more than pushing around piles of money.

Zeretski had submitted his first paper to the Journal of Physics when he was
only sixteen and a student at the University of Budapest.  Shortly after, he was
recruited to Princeton University where he completed his Nobel prize winning
work on electronic transfer, which had led to the low cost electrification of
cities and towns throughout the country.

After winning the Nobel prize though, the focus of his scientific work had
shifted in the direction of the exotic. Having achieved success so early in
life and without serious struggle or defeat, it seemed he felt that nothing
was impossible or possibly having earned it all too easily, he was merely
protecting himself in a 'somethig' cloak of bravado.

With substantial financial backing, he had built a large laboratory in the
warehouse district of Manhattan with a staff which at its peak numbered 34.
And though his work was moderately successful, it had never lived up to his
promises. 

As his work produced more failures, his promises grew more outlandish. He
had taken to giving garish demonstrations that often included enormous
sparks and blasts of colorful smoke, bordering on theater, as if, in
desparation, he felt it might be possible to conjure reality from well
crafted make believe.  Over the years, he developed the reputation of a mad
scientist, but Judith was convinced that his most recent work, their work,
was quite real.

After the meeting, Jonson and Franklin met privately. "Do you think it is
possible that he has achieved what he claims" asked Jonson. "Well, if he
has, the potential is enormous." replied Franklin and added "Of course,
investing in him at this point could pose a serious risk to our
reputation." "We could try to keep it under wraps." replied Jonson.  "You
know that would never work with him and besides, even if it turns out that
is on to something, I suspect he would be a less than ideal business
partner. We need to find out more about his work and then get the opinion
of people we trust. Then we can decide what to do."

"Should I call Mueller?" asked Jonson. "Yes. Let's get him started with the
usual contract."

Stanley Mueller was listed under private detectives in the Yellow Pages but
mostly because there was no heading for criminal. To be fair, he did
investigative work, but his work often and intentionally crossed legal
boundaries. Before setting up his own practice, he had been a police
officer, but he had left the force after only a few years and after being
investigated for tampering with evidence. He found his present work better
suited to his natural tendencies.

A couple of weeks after their meeting, Judith walked into the San Marco
where she went every Thursday evening to read a book and have a meal. The
San Marco was a lively restaurant with dancing and a band, and a place not
generally conducive to a quiet evening, but it was also a place that gave
her a sense of peace that she did not find at work or home. Tucked away at
the end of the bar she was bounded by the feral energy of life and yet felt
protected from it or possibly by it. It was also a place where the
bartender and patrons usually left her alone.

This evening the club was more crowded than usual, but she found her seat
waiting for her at the end of the bar. A few minutes after she sat down,
the man next to her offered to buy her a drink. Without looking up from her
book she said "No thanks", and waited for the bartender to find her. 

The man then asked her what she was reading. Barely turning her head she
named the title of the book and the author. He went on to say that he had
read another book by the same author and asked her what she thought of it.
This was generally her cue to leave, but as she turned and saw a face far
more handsome than the ones that sometimes tried to get her attention, she
paused and then she answered "Yes, she had."

She stayed and they talked about books. She found that he was not widely
read, but he asked lots of questions and showed a sincere interest in her
opinions. He told her he was a salesman for a regional electronics
manufacturing company. She said she worked as a scientific lab assistant.
By the end of the evening, he had lured her off her perch and into the
swirling crowd on the dance floor. 

The next day, she was not herself. She could feel the emotions of a
character from one of her novels swimming around in her head, but as soon
as she focused on one, it slipped away. As if the mere act of observation
where enough to make it vanish.  cold analysis, her stock-in-trade The
light of day were enough spectral quality.  It was as if the mere
observation of any feeling was enough to make it But observation was her
stock-in-trade and this topic was the focus of her work, but somehow she
was unable to make the connection. 

That same day Stanley Mueller was seated in Johnson's office explaining
that he had met the girl, and expected that within the next couple of weeks
he would be able get inside the lab and make time to copy the relevant
documents. Johnson said there was no real rush and that he didn't care to
know the details, but just to let him know when he had the material.

The following Saturday, Judith waited for him outside a new restaurant in
mid-town. On the surface she felt apprehensive, but below the surface where
her feelings had been there was now a void. She felt neither the chaotic
emotions of human attraction nor the purely analytical intensity with which
she approached her work and life. She felt nothing but the sense of a true
void waiting to be filled. As if all the combatants had momentarily
retreated from the battle field leaving a sudden and eerie silence. 

When she turned, she saw this handsome smiling man walking toward her and
she no longer felt able to considered her own thoughts. They greeted each
other awkwardly. They paused and there was a moment when either one could
have reached out, a hand touching sleeve or shoulder but did not. He opened
the door leading her into the restaurant where he had reserved a table.
During the evening they talked and laughed. Having no previous buffer for
these sorts of emotions, she was now completely overwhelmed. 

The next day, looking up from her microscope she rested her eyes and stared
at the wall. For the past hour, she had been counting red blood cells. The
count was part of an experiment that they had been running for the past
month. As her mind began to wonder, she turned to watch Zeretski fiddling
with an electronic circuit that was part of their latest experimental
apparatus.  As she watched him, she mentioned that she had recently met a
man she liked. Engrossed in his work, he responded with slight "hmmm", but
only enough to politely acknowledge her presence and no more. She paused
still watching him and then added that the man was a great admirer of
Zeretski's work. Something seemed to catch his attention, most likely the
mention of his name and he turned and said "I'm sorry, what were you
saying."

She immediately found herself rambling about this person she had just met.
Zeretski turned from his work and listened politely and nodded
appropriately. When she got to the point of describing how Zeretski had
been one his childhood heroes and how much he wanted to met him, Zeretski
showed a sudden interest and asked, "Where did you say you met him?" She
described the bar. And then with a more intense curiosity "And why did he
say he wanted to meet me?" She again repeated his admiration for Zeretski
and described his childhood dream of becoming scientist but never having
the money to afford college. 

Zeretski's curiosity turned to suspicion. He asked her more about what she
knew about him which was not a lot. He began to sew doubts about his
motives. Like most scientists Zeretski was protective of his work, but over
the past few years, his suspicions began to seem like paranoia as there
level increased disproportionately to any increased value of his work. 

about why he was interested in her, but these may have just been doubts in
his own head

Why was he show deep down he
wondered why anyone would want to see his work. Didn't she know that other
scientist had tried to steal his work. But Judith was used to this sort of
behavior which had been kindly described as mercurial and less kindly as
raving mad. Zeretski ended by saying, "You must promise me that he is not
to come here under any circumstances."

But Zeretski's questions did raise her own doubts. Who was this man and
what did she really know about him? More importantly, why her. Yes, this
was what puzzled her most. What did he see in her? These doubts creeped out
of her subconscious offering safety from what had been feeling dangerous
since it all started. Looking for an excuse had she found one? 

For the next week and a half, Mueller tried to contact her, repeatedly
calling her apartment and leaving messages with the building's answering
service. When a week and half later she finally picked up the phone and
said, "Hello" he was taken a back. "I thought I might never reach you
again." he said. "And I thought you might never stop trying." She replied.
He half laughed not sure what to make of this. She apologized and said that
she was busy at work and getting home late each night, but agreed to meet
him the following Friday to see a show.

After the show, they walked together from the theater and talked. She
could not push back the

enjoyed his company her feelings now held a certain edge.  raised by her
fears. kkk
All through the evening, she had felt on edge. His simple charm had started
to seem dull and his attention had started to seem fawning.

He noticed that they seemed to be headed away from the crowds and into the
warehouse district where Zeretski had his lab. When they arrived at an
overtly nondescript entrance to a large wharehouse under a light that
dramatically flickered and buzzed as if perpetually about to blow out, she
asked "Would you like to come in and see the lab?"

Mueller was impressed. The lab certainly lived up to its reputation.  She
showed him through rooms that contained glass cylinders with smoke pouring from
them, large metal columns emitting sparks, and various biological objects
suspended in sealed glass jars. Though many of the experiments gave the
impression that they had been running unattended for years.

As she led him into what appeared to be the main room, Mueller saw a space
over two stories high. Much of the walls were covered in thick electrical
wires and what looked like electrical transformer boxes giving the
impression that whatever went on in here, it needed a lot of power. In the
middle of the room was a large apparatus that appeared to be the focal
point of all the machinery that surrounded them.

She was feeling more relaxed as she walked through a place that felt like 

As Judith led him to the center of the room, she revealed that Zeretski's
latest work was on the ability to control the attraction between humans.
She described their work in modest detail and then asked Mueller if he
thought this was even possible. He said, "To be honest, it seems a bit far
fetched." "What makes you think so?" She asked.  "Well it seems that
emotions are somewhat outside the bounds of science." he said. "And from
what base of knowledge do you draw your understanding of the bounds of
science?" she asked suddenly feeling irritated and in a tone mocking him.
"Well, just because I never went to college, doesn't mean I don't have
common sense." "Common sense" she said laughed, "What has common sense got
to do with anything?" Irratated, they each continued forward each blindly
responding to the other's comments until they stopped.  

For a moment they just looked at each other. He frustrated and she
embarrassed by losing control over her emotions. "Listen I'm sorry" she
said, "Maybe we should just go." As she turned to walk toward the door. He
reached out to stop her. "Wait" he said. "I really want to stay and see
more." "No. I think it is best we leave." She said pulling away from him.

Not sure what to do, he held her arm, but before he could reason with her,
she dug her nails into his arm and pulled him forward. Surprised, he lost
his balance and fell against her. Reaching out to stop her own fall she
grabbed a control panel on the machine. Suddenly there was a loud noise
like a crack of thunder and they were awash in a burst of light,
momentarily frozen as if captured in an overexposed photo. And then, just
as suddenly, the light was gone.

As they left the lab and headed back toward the still bustling city night,
Mueller said, "I have something to confess." Without stopping she put her
hand in his pocket and holding his hand said, "Save your confessions for
later. Right now, let's go get something to eat. I am suddenly feeling
famished."
