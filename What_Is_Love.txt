As Professor Zeretski described his new discovery he wrote equations on the
blackboard. Each equation punctuated a point in his argument and each point
was emphasized by his tapping the board with his chalk as if numbers, more
than words, could be relied on to carry truth. But the truth was that his
latest discovery sounded outlandish, maybe too outlandish, when described
in plain English.

His audience, six men and one woman, were sitting around a large and
expensive conference table in a room with a view looking out from the
Manhattan skyline.  The blackboard, out of place in the room, had been
brought in for his presentation. No one had spoken since he began his
lecture, but their patience was clearly beginning to wear as they started
looking at each other with glances that confided how little they understood
of what he was saying.

The one woman in the room was the professor's lab assistant, Judith Kitts.  A
woman in her early 30s who had worked for him since she was a teenager. She
was the reason he was here. The professor needed money and she knew these were
the people who could give it to him. 

Finally, Mr. Jonson, one of the older gentlemen at the table, cleared his
throat and interrupting Zeretski said, "Professor, with the likely exception of
Ms. Kitts, we have only the vaguest notion of what you are talking about. Do
you think you could explain your latest discovery in less scientific terms?"

Professor Zeretski paused for a moment and stared out the window as if
something else had caught his attention. He then turned back to look at
Jonson and said, "I have discovered love." "Love?" said Jonson.  Love
thought Judith.  Well that was certainly laying it plain. At least he now
had their attention.

"My dear professor, I do hope you have not come here just to tell us that
you have fallen in love." "No, No" replied the professor as if he were in
on the joke. "I have discovered the force of attraction between humans. Not
only have I discovered what causes this attraction. I know how to make it
happen."

"Are you saying you know how to make people fall in love?" Said Mr. Franklin,
who together with Jonson, directed the investment firm of Franklin and Jonson.
"Not love precisely. I have discovered the force of attraction between people,
what makes them close friends or mortal enemies. Like the fundamental forces of
gravity or magnetism, human attraction is a quantifiable force that can pull
people together or push them apart." 

"Maybe you can help Halpern here" said one of the younger men at the table,
gesturing toward the man sitting next to him. "He's been chatting up the bar
maid at Pete's Pub for weeks now and she still won't give him the time of day."

"Then scientifically speaking, there is no attraction between them." said
Zeretski.  "Oh, I wouldn't say that. Poor Halpern is half mad for the young
lady, and with good reason, I might add." Halpern tired to smile, but was
not entirely comfortable with this discussion of his personal life.

"No" responded the professor shaking his head. "Young Halpern is no more
attracted to the bar maid than this a wooden chair could feel an attraction
to the most powerful magnet on earth. The attraction between humans" he
continued, "behaves like any other force. It must be mutual."

Zeretski lifted a glass of water off the table and held it above the floor.
"While it is easy imagine the massive Earth pulling the tiny glass, it is
harder to imagine the tiny glass pulling the massive Earth. But the fact is
that the attraction and between the two objects is the same." Dropping the
glass on the carpeted floor, he said, "The only reason the Earth moves so
little is simply its size."

As the glass lay on the floor, he addressed Halpern directly "You feel
like you are supposed to like this bar maid and so you invent an
artificial sense of attraction where none exists." The room was silent for
a moment as the men contemplated their own relationships with wives,
friends and family.

But it was love, thought Judith, that he had discovered. Although love was 
something with which she had little direct experience.
Is it love if only one person feels it? She loved her fatherHer knowledge of the
subject came mostly from books and movies and the confidences of her few
friends.  Her father, a man devoted to his own scientific work, had gotten
her the job in Zeretski's lab before he died and before she finished high
school. Since then she had devoted herself to his work.

The conversation turned to the status of Zeretski's discovery and what proof he
had for his claims. Zeretski confessed that, to date, his only experiments had
been with animals --to be precise two mice named Harold and Helen. 

The tone of the meeting shifted again with the gentlemen now poking fun at
the notion of two mice in love. Judith understood their skepticism, but
felt angry that they could show so little respect for a man who had won the
Nobel Prize for physics at the age of 28. Men whose only work she felt
amounted to nothing more than pushing around piles of money.

Zeretski had submitted his first paper to the Journal of Physics when he was
only sixteen and a student at the University of Budapest.  Shortly after, he was
recruited to Princeton University where he completed his Nobel prize winning
work on electronic transfer, which had led to the low cost electrification of
cities and towns throughout the country.

After winning the Nobel prize though, the focus of his scientific work had
shifted in the direction of the exotic. Having achieved success so early in
life and without serious struggle or defeat, it seemed he felt that nothing
was impossible or possibly having earned it all too easily, he worried none of
it was real.

With substantial financial backing, he had built a large laboratory in the
warehouse district of Manhattan with a staff which at its peak numbered 34.
And though his work was moderately successful, it had never lived up to his
promises. 

As his work produced more failures, his promises grew more outlandish. He
had taken to giving garish demonstrations that often included enormous
sparks and blasts of colorful smoke, bordering on theater, as if in
desparation, he might conjure reality from well crafted make believe. Over
the years, he developed the reputation of a mad scientist, but Judith was
convinced that his most recent work, their work, was quite real.

After the meeting, Jonson and Franklin met privately.  "Do you think it is
possible that he has achieved what he claims" asked Jonson. "Well, if he
has, the potential is enormous." replied Franklin and added "Of course,
investing in him at this point could pose a serious risk to our
reputation." "We could try to keep it under wraps." replied Jonson.  "You
know that would never work with him and besides, even if it turns out that
he is on to something, I suspect he would make a less than ideal business
partner. We need to find out more about his work and then get the opinion
of people we trust. Then we can decide what to do."

"Should I call Mueller?" asked Jonson. "Yes. Let's get him started with the
usual contract."

Stanley Mueller was listed under private detectives in the Yellow Pages
though mostly because there was no heading for criminal. To be fair, he did
investigative work, but his work usually and intentionally crossed legal
boundaries. Stanley was a man who liked to get things done and he generally
tried to take the shortest path to his objective. 

He had grown up in the city, never finished high and moved from a life on
the streets to his present occupation. He had a good reputation with
(aggressive white collar criminal, he served the other side) and made a
decent living. He lived alone dating series of women until each one
realized that the present state was the future state. The only ticking
clock he heard was the one marching him through life.

A couple of weeks after their meeting, Judith walked into the San Marco
where she went every Thursday evening to read a book and have a meal. The
San Marco was a lively restaurant with dancing and a band. It was not a
place generally conducive to a quiet evening, but for Judith it was a place
that gave her a sense of peace that she did not find at work or home.
Tucked away at the end of the bar she was bounded by the energy of life and
yet protected from it or possibly by it. It was also a place where the
bartender and patrons usually left her alone.

This evening the club was more crowded than usual, but she found her seat
waiting for her at the end of the bar. A few minutes after she sat down,
the man next to her offered to buy her a drink. Without looking up from her
book she said "No thanks", and waited for the bartender to find her. 

The man then asked her what she was reading. Barely turning her head she
named the title of the book and the author. He went on to say that he had
read another book by the same author and asked her what she thought of it.
This was generally her cue to leave, but as she turned and saw a smiling
and handsome face, far more handsome than the ones that sometimes tried to
get her attention. She paused and then she answered "Yes, she had."

She stayed and they talked about books. She found that he was not widely
read, but he asked lots of questions and showed a sincere interest in her
opinions. He told her he was a salesman for a regional electronics
manufacturing company. She said she worked as a scientific lab assistant.
By the end of the evening, he lured her off her perch and into the swirling
crowd on the dance floor. 

The next day, she was not herself. She felt powerful emotions swimming
around in her head. Like imps from the deep they grabbed her, pulling her
this way and that and never sitting still long enough for proper
investigation. She could find no words in her vocabulary with which to
define them. At best she could say she felt good and she wanted to feel
more.

Was this love she thought? After only one evening, a mere four
hours, how could she feel the sort of attraction that was defined, this
mythic love. 

She knew she desired to see him again and she knew this sort of force
existed in a scientific sense, but how could she be sure it was real. As
Zaretski claimed it was possible to manifest as sense of desire where none
existed.

and having no previous buffer for these sorts of emotions, she
felt overwhelmed.

That same day Stanley Mueller was seated in Johnson's office explaining
that he had met the girl, and expected that within the next couple of weeks
he would be able get inside the lab and make time to copy the relevant
documents. Johnson said there was no real rush and that he didn't care to
know the details, but just to let him know when he had the material.

The following Saturday, Judith waited for Stanley outside a new restaurant
in mid-town. The intervening days had tempered her emotions to the point
that where her feelings had always been there was now a void. She felt
neither the chaotic emotions of human attraction nor the purely analytical
intensity with which she usually approached her work and life. She felt
nothing but the sense of a true void waiting to be filled, as if all the
combatants had momentarily retreated from the battle field leaving a sudden
and eerie silence. 

As she turned, she saw him walking toward her. Having only seen him once
before she was still etching his final image in her head, but he was still
handsome and smiling and thoughts of her own thoughts disappeared. They
greeted each other awkwardly. They paused. There was a moment when either
one could have reached out, a hand touching sleeve or shoulder but did not.
He opened the door leading her into the restaurant where he had reserved a
table. During the evening they talked and laughed.  

For weeks they dated until these emotions for which she could still not
find a name became less illusive and began to dominate her consciousness
camped out became less illusive more familiar but no less
difficult to name or fathom.  

One day, looking up from her microscope she rested her eyes and stared at
the wall. For the past hour, she had been counting red blood cells. The
count was part of an experiment that they had been running for the past
month. As her mind began to wonder, she turned to watch Zeretski fiddling
with an electronic circuit that was part of their latest experimental
apparatus.  As she watched him, she mentioned that she had recently met a
man she liked. Engrossed in his work, he responded with slight "hmmm", but
only enough to politely acknowledge that she had spoken and no more. She
paused still watching him and then added that the man was a great admirer
of Zeretski's work. Something seemed to catch his attention, most likely
the mention of his name and he turned and said "I'm sorry, what were you
saying."

She immediately found herself rambling about this person she had just met.
Zeretski turned from his work and listened politely and nodded
appropriately. When she got to the point of describing how Zeretski had
been one his childhood heroes and how much he wanted to met him, Zeretski
showed a sudden interest and asked, "Where did you say you met him?" She
described the bar. And then with a more intense curiosity "And why did he
say he wanted to meet me?" She again repeated his admiration for Zeretski
and described his childhood dream of becoming scientist but never having
the money to afford college. 

Zeretski's curiosity turned to suspicion. He asked her more questions about
what she knew about him which was not a lot and he began to sew doubts
about his motives. Like most scientists Zeretski was protective of his
work, but over the past few years, his suspicions began to border on
paranoia as they increased disproportionately with repect to any success in
his work.  Zeretski ended by saying, "You must promise me that he is not to
come here under any circumstances."

But Zeretski's questions did raise doubts. Who was this man and what did
she really know about him? More importantly, why her? Yes, this was what
puzzled her most. What did he see in her? These doubts came creeping out of
her subconscious. They offered to protect her from the danger she had felt
since it all started, a sense of danger for which they may have been
wholly responsible. 

For the next week and a half, Mueller tried to contact her, repeatedly
calling her apartment and leaving messages with the building's answering
service. When a week and half later she finally picked up the phone and
said, "Hello" he was taken a back. "I thought I might never reach you
again." he said. "And I thought you might never stop trying." She replied.
He half laughed not sure what to make of this. She apologized and said that
she was busy at work and getting home late each night, but agreed to meet
him the following Friday to see a show.

After the show, they walked together from the theater and talked. She felt
more relaxed with him than she had in their past encounters, but it was a
confidence that came with a sharper attention to detail and contrast.

He noticed that they seemed to be headed away from the crowds and into the
warehouse district where Zeretski had his lab. When they arrived at an
overtly nondescript entrance to a large wharehouse under a light that
dramatically flickered and buzzed as if perpetually about to blow out, she
asked "Would you like to come in and see the lab?"

Mueller was impressed. The lab certainly lived up to its reputation.  She
showed him through rooms that contained glass cylinders with smoke pouring from
them, large metal columns emitting sparks, and various biological objects
suspended in sealed glass jars. Though many of the experiments gave the
impression that they had been running unattended for years.

As she led him into what appeared to be the main room, Mueller saw a space
over two stories high. Much of the walls were covered in thick electrical
wires and what looked like electrical transformer boxes giving the
impression that whatever went on in here, it needed a lot of power. In the
middle of the room was a large apparatus that appeared to be the focal
point of all the machinery that surrounded them.

As Judith led him to the center of the room, she revealed that Zeretski's
latest work was on the ability to control the attraction between humans.
She described their work in modest detail and then asked Mueller if he
thought this was even possible. He said, "To be honest, it seems a bit far
fetched." "What makes you think so?" She asked.  "Well it seems that
emotions are somewhat outside the bounds of science." he said. "And from
what base of knowledge do you draw your understanding of the bounds of
science?" she asked suddenly feeling irritated and in mocking tone.  "Well,
just because I never went to college, doesn't mean I don't have common
sense." "Common sense" she said laughed, "What has common sense got to do
with anything?" Irratated, they each continued on, each blindly pursuing
their own point of view until they both stopped.  

For a moment they just looked at each other. He frustrated at what he
percieved as her arrogance and she embarrassed by losing control over her
feelings. "Listen I'm sorry" she said, "Maybe we should just go." As she
turned to walk toward the door. He reached out to stop her. "Wait" he said.
"I really want to stay and see more." "No. I think it is best we leave."
She said pulling away from him.

Not sure what to do, he held her arm, but before he could reason with her,
she dug her nails into his arm and pulled him forward. Surprised, he lost
his balance and fell against her. Reaching out to stop her own fall she
grabbed a control panel on the machine. Suddenly there was a loud noise
like a crack of thunder and they were awash in a burst of light,
momentarily frozen as if captured in an overexposed photo. And then, just
as suddenly, the light was gone.

As they left the lab and headed back toward the still bustling city night,
Mueller said, "I have something to confess." Without stopping she held his
and more tightly and said, "Let's save our confessions for later and go get
something to eat. I am suddenly feeling famished."
