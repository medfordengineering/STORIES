As Professor Zeretski spoke, he wrote equations on the blackboard. Each
equation punctuated a point in his argument and each point was emphasized
by tapping the board with his chalk as if numbers, more than words, could
be relied on to carry truth. But the truth was that his latest discovery
sounded outlandish, maybe too outlandish, when described in plain English.

His audience, six men and one woman, were sitting around a large and
expensive conference table in a room with a view looking out from the
Manhattan skyline.  The blackboard, out of place in the room, had been
brought in for his presentation. No one had spoken since he began his
lecture, but their patience was clearly beginning to wear as they started
looking at each other with glances that confided how little they understood
of what he was saying.

The one woman in the room was the professor's lab assistant, Judith Kitts.  A
woman in her early 30s who had worked for him since she was a teenager. She
was the reason he was here. The professor needed money and she knew these were
the people who could give it to him. 

Finally, Mr. Jonson, one of the older gentlemen at the table, cleared his
throat and interrupting Zeretski said, "Professor, with the likely exception of
Ms. Kitts, we have only the vaguest notion of what you are talking about. Do
you think you could explain your latest discovery in less scientific terms?"

Professor Zeretski paused for a moment and stared out the window as if
something else had caught his attention. He then turned back to look at
Jonson and said, "I have discovered love." "Love?" said Jonson.  Love
thought Judith.  Well that was certainly laying it plain. At least he now
had their attention.

"My dear professor, I do hope you have not come here just to tell us that
you have fallen in love." "No, No" replied the professor as if he were in
on the joke. "I have discovered the force of attraction between humans. Not
only have I discovered what causes this attraction. I know how to make it
happen."

"Are you saying you know how to make people fall in love?" Said Mr. Franklin,
who together with Jonson, directed the investment firm of Franklin and Jonson.
"Not love precisely. I have discovered the force of attraction between people,
what makes them close friends or mortal enemies. Like the fundamental forces of
gravity or magnetism, human attraction is a quantifiable force that can pull
people together or push them apart." 

"Maybe you can help Halpern here" said one of the younger men at the table,
gesturing toward the man sitting next to him. "He's been chatting up the bar
maid at Pete's Pub for weeks now and she still won't give him the time of day."

"Then scientifically speaking, there is no attraction between them." said
Zeretski.  "Oh, I wouldn't say that. Poor Halpern is half mad for the young
lady, and with good reason, I might add." Halpern tired to smile, but was
not entirely comfortable with this discussion of his personal life.

"No" responded the professor shaking his head. "Young Halpern is no more
attracted to the bar maid than this a wooden chair could feel an attraction
to the most powerful magnet on earth. The attraction between humans" he
continued, "behaves like any other force. It must be mutual."

Zeretski lifted a glass of water off the table and held it above the floor.
"While it is easy imagine the massive Earth pulling the tiny glass, it is
harder to imagine the tiny glass pulling the massive Earth. But the fact is
that the attraction and between the two objects is the same." Dropping the
glass on the carpeted floor, he said, "The only reason the Earth moves so
little is simply its size."

As the glass lay on the floor, he addressed Halpern directly "You feel
like you are supposed to like this bar maid and so you invent an
artificial sense of attraction where none exists." The room was silent for
a moment as the men contemplated their own relationships with wives,
friends and family.

But it was love, thought Judith, that he had discovered. Although love was
something with which she had little direct experience. Her knowledge of the
subject came mostly from books and movies and the confidences of her few
friends.  Her father, a man devoted to his own scientific work, had gotten
her the job in Zeretski's lab before he died and before she finished high
school. Since then she had devoted herself to his work.

The conversation turned to the status of Zeretski's discovery and what proof he
had for his claims. Zeretski confessed that, to date, his only experiments had
been with animals --to be precise two mice named Harold and Helen. 

The tone of the meeting shifted again with the gentlemen now poking fun at
the notion of two mice in love. Judith understood their skepticism, but
felt angry that they could show so little respect for a man who had won the
Nobel Prize for physics at the age of 28. Men whose only work she felt
amounted to nothing more than pushing around piles of money.

Zeretski had submitted his first paper to the Journal of Physics when he was
only sixteen and a student at the University of Budapest.  Shortly after, he was
recruited to Princeton University where he completed his Nobel prize winning
work on electronic transfer, which had led to the low cost electrification of
cities and towns throughout the country.

After winning the Nobel prize though, the focus of his scientific work had
shifted in the direction of the exotic. Having achieved success so early in
life and without serious struggle or defeat, it seemed he felt that nothing
was impossible or possibly having earned it all too easily, he was merely
protecting himself in a cloak of bravado.

With substantial financial backing, he had built a large laboratory in the
warehouse district of Manhattan with a staff which at its peak numbered 34.
And though his work was moderately successful, it had never lived up to his
promises. 

As his work produced more failures, his promises grew more outlandish. He
had taken to giving garish demonstrations that often included enormous
sparks and blasts of colorful smoke, bordering on theater, as if he felt
it might be possible to conjure reality from well crafted make believe.
Over the years, he developed the reputation of a mad scientist, but Judith
was convinced that his most recent work, their work, was quite real.

After the meeting, Jonson and Franklin met privately. "Do you think it is
possible that he has achieved what he claims" asked Jonson. "Well, if he
has, the potential is enormous." replied Franklin and added "Of course,
investing in him at this point could pose a serious risk to our
reputation." "We could try to keep it under wraps." replied Jonson.  "You
know that would never work with him and besides, even if it turns out that
is on to something, I suspect he would be a less than ideal business
partner. We need to find out more about his work and then get the opinion
of people we trust. Then we can decide what to do."

"Should I call Mueller?" asked Jonson. "Yes. Let's get him started with the
usual contract."

Stanley Mueller was a private detective. Although, he looked the part by
Hollywood standards, he was not flashy or particularly clever. He was also
not interested in tales of hard luck or contingency arrangements. His only
specialty was in cases that paid and he was good at his job in a dull and
persistent sort of way.  If you had cash and wanted information than
Mueller was your man. 

A few days after their meeting, Judith walked into the San Marco where she
came every Thursday evening to read a book and have a meal. Although the
San Marco was a lively restaurant with dancing and a band, it was a place
where the bartender and patrons usually left her alone.

This evening the club was more crowded than usual, but she found her usual
seat waiting for her at the end of the bar. After she sat down, the man
next to her offered to buy her a drink. Without looking up she said "No
thanks", brought out her book and waited for the bartender to find her. 

The man asked her what she was reading. She named the author. He then
mentioned another author that she knew and then asked if she had read his
latest book. This was generally her que to leave, but then she turned and
saw a face far more handsome than the ones that sometimes tried to get her
attention. She stopped and then she answered "Yes, she had."

She stayed and they talked about books. She found that he was not widely
read, but he showed a sincere interest in her opinions. He told her he was
a salesman for a regional electronics manufacturing company. She said she
worked as a scientific lab assistant. By the end of the evening, he was
even able to lure her off her perch and into the swirling crowd on the dance
floor. 

The next day, the cliched emotions of a character from one of her novels
began to swim around in her head, but as soon as she focused on one, it
slipped away. All day these feelings where there and then gone. It was as
if mere observation was enough to make them disappear. But observation was
her stock and trade and it was not in her nature to let go. It did not help
that this was also the focus of her scientific work.

That same day Stanely Mueller was seated in Johnson's office explaining
that he had met the girl, and expected that within the next couple of weeks
he would be able get inside the lab and make time to copy the relevant
documents. Johnson said there was no real rush and that he didn't care to
know the details, but just to let him know when he had the material.

The following Saturday, Judith waited for him outside a new restaurant in
mid-town. She was apprehensive, but had been trying to think about all this
as just part of her work. Seeing him was different. What had become one
side of an equation in her head, was now this tall handsome smiling man
walking toward her. They paused, greeted each other awkwardly. He lead her
into the restaurant where he had reserved a table. During the evening they
talked and laughed. Having no previous buffer for these sorts of emotions,
she was overwhelmed. 

Looking up from the microscope she rested her eyes. For the past hour, she
had been counting red blood cells. This was part of an experiment that they
had been running for the past two months. She watched Zeretski fiddling
with an electronic circuit that was part of their experimental apparatus.
As she watched, she told him that she had recently met a man she liked. His
only response was a "Hmm" not looking up from the focus of his attention.
She paused and then continued that the man was a great admirer of
Zeretski's work. Something caught his attention, possibly just the mention
of his name and he turned and said "I'm sorry, what were you saying."

She immediately found herself rambling as she described this new man and
how she met him and what she thought of him. Zeretski listened politely and
nodded appropriately. Finally, she got to the point of describing how
Zeretski has been one his childhood heros and how much he wanted to met
him. At this, Zeretski asked, "Where did you say you met him?" She
described the bar. "And why did he say he wanted to meet me?" asked
Zeretski. She described his desire to be a scientist but never having the
money to afford college. 

Zeretski suddenly became suspicious and launched into a rant about how
other scientist had tried to steal his work. It was less of a condemnation
of her and more of monolog of paranoia. But Judith was used to this sort of
behavior which had been kindly described as mercurial and less kindly as
raving mad. Zeretski ended by saying, "You must promise me that he is not
to come here under any circumstances."

But Zeretski's questions did raise her own doubts. Who was this man and
what did she really know about him? More importantly, why her. Yes, this
was what puzzled her most. What did he see in her? These doubts creeped out
of her subconscious offering protection. Looking for an excuse had she
found one? 

For the next week and a half, Mueller tried to contact her, repeatedly
calling her apartment and leaving messages with the building's answering
service. When a week and half later she finally picked up the phone and
said, "Hello" he was taken a back. "I thought I might never reach you
again." he said. "And I thought you might never stop trying." She replied.
He half laughed not sure what to make of this. She apologized and said that
she was busy at work and getting home late each night, but agreed to meet
him the following Friday to see a show.

After the show, they walked together from the theater and talked. He
noticed that they seemed to be headed away from the crowds and into the
warehouse district where Zeretski had his lab. When they arrived at an
overtly nondescript door of an overtly nondescript building under a light
that ostentatiously flickered and buzzed as if perpetually about to blow out,
she asked "Would you like to come in and see the lab?"

Mueller was impressed. The lab certainly lived up to its reputation.  She
showed him through rooms that contained glass cylinders with smoke pouring from
them, large metal columns emitting sparks, and various biological objects
suspended in sealed glass jars. Though many of the experiments gave the
impression that they had been running unattended for years.

While she was enjoying his seemingly genuine interest in the lab, she had
felt on edge all evening. His folksy charm had started to seem dull and his
attention had started to seem fawning.

As she led him into what appeared to be the main room, Mueller saw a space
over two stories high. Much of the walls were covered in thick electrical
wires and what looked like electrical transformer boxes giving the
impression that whatever went on in here, it needed a lot of power. In the
middle of the room was a large apparatus that appeared to be the focal
point of all the machinery that surrounded them.

As Judith led him to the center of the room, revealed that Zeretski's
latest work was on the ability to control the attraction between humans.
She asked Mueller if he thought this was even possible. He said, "To be
honest, it seems a bit far fetched." "What makes you think so?" She asked.
"Well it seems that emotions are somewhat outside the bounds of science."
he said. "And from what base of knowledge do you draw your understanding of
the bounds of science?" she asked her tone mocking him. "Well, just because
I never went to college, doesn't mean I don't have common sense." "Common
sense" she said laughed, "What has common sense got to do with anything?" 

For a moment they just looked at each other. He frustrated and she suddenly
embarrassed by her own behavior.  "Listen I'm sorry" she said, "Maybe we
should just go." As she turned to walk toward the door. He reached out to
stop her. "Wait" he said. "I really want to stay and see more." "No. I
think it is best we leave." She said pulling away from him.

Not sure what to do, he held her, but before he could reason with her, she
dug her nails into his arm and pulled him forward. Surprised, he lost his
balance and fell against her. Reaching out to stop her own fall she grabbed
a control panel on the machine. Suddenly there was a loud crack and they
were awash in a burst of light, momentarily frozen as if in an overexposed
photo. And then, just as suddenly, the light was gone.

As they left the lab and headed back toward the still bustling city night,
Mueller said, "I have something to confess." Without stopping she put her
hand in his pocket and holding his hand said, "Confessions are for priests,
Dear. Right now, let's go get something to eat. I am suddenly feeling
famished."
