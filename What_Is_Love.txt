As Professor Zeretski spoke, he wrote equations on the blackboard. Each
equation punctuated a point in his argument and each point was emphasized
by tapping the board with his chalk as if numbers, more than words, could
be relied on to carry truth. But the truth was that his latest discovery
sounded outlandish, maybe too outlandish, when described in plain English.

His audience, six men and one woman, were sitting around a large and
expensive conference table in a room with a view looking out from the
Manhattan skyline.  The blackboard, out of place in the room, had been
brought in for his presentation. No one had spoken since he began his
lecture, but their patience was clearly beginning to wear as they started
looking at each other with glances that confided how little they understood
of what he was saying.

The one woman in the room was the professor's lab assistant, Judith Kitts.  A
woman in her early 30s who had worked for him since she was a teenager. She
was the reason he was here. The professor needed money and she knew these were
the people who could give it to him. 

Finally, Mr. Jonson, one of the older gentlemen at the table, cleared his
throat and interrupting Zeretski said, "Professor, with the likely exception of
Ms. Kitts, we have only the vaguest notion of what you are talking about. Do
you think you could explain your latest discovery in less scientific terms?"

Professor Zeretski paused for a moment and stared out the window as if
something else had caught his attention. He then turned back to look at
Jonson and said, "I have discovered love." "Love?" said Jonson.  Love
thought Judith.  Well that was certainly laying it plain. At least he now
had their attention.

"My dear professor, I do hope you have not come here just to tell us that
you have fallen in love." "No, No" replied the professor as if he were in
on the joke. "I have discovered the force of attraction between humans. Not
only have I discovered what causes this attraction. I know how to make it
happen."

"Are you saying you know how to make people fall in love?" Said Mr. Franklin,
who together with Jonson, directed the investment firm of Franklin and Jonson.
"Not love precisely. I have discovered the force of attraction between people,
what makes them close friends or mortal enemies. Like the fundamental forces of
gravity or magnetism, human attraction is a quantifiable force that can pull
people together or push them apart." 

"Maybe you can help Halpern here" said one of the younger men at the table,
gesturing toward the man sitting next to him. "He's been chatting up the bar
maid at Pete's Pub for weeks now and she still won't give him the time of day."

"Then scientifically speaking, there is no attraction between them." said
Zeretski.  "Oh, I wouldn't say that. Poor Halpern is half mad for the young
lady, and with good reason, I might add." Halpern tired to smile, but was
not entirely comfortable with this discussion of his personal life.

"No" responded the professor shaking his head. "Young Halpern is no more
attracted to the bar maid than this a wooden chair could feel an attraction
to the most powerful magnet on earth. The attraction between humans" he
continued, "behaves like any other force. It must be mutual."

Zeretski lifted a glass of water off the table and held it above the floor.
"While it is easy imagine the massive Earth pulling the tiny glass, it is
harder to imagine the tiny glass pulling the massive Earth. But the fact is
that the attraction and between the two objects is the same." Dropping the
glass on the carpeted floor, he said, "The only reason the Earth moves so
little is simply its size."

As the glass lay on the floor, he addressed Halpern directly "You feel
like you are supposed to like this bar maid and so you invent an
artificial sense of attraction where none exists." The room was silent for
a moment as the men contemplated their own relationships with wives,
friends and family.

But it was love, thought Judith, that he had discovered. Although love was
something with which she had little direct experience. Her knowledge of the
subject came mostly from books and movies and the confidences of her few
friends.  Her father, a man devoted to his own scientific work, had gotten
her the job in Zeretski's lab before he died and before she finished high
school. Since then she had devoted herself to his work.

The conversation turned to the status of Zeretski's discovery and what proof he
had for his claims. Zeretski confessed that, to date, his only experiments had
been with animals --to be precise two mice named Harold and Helen. 

The tone of the meeting shifted again with the gentlemen now poking fun at
the notion of two mice in love. Judith understood their skepticism, but
felt angry that they could show so little respect for a man who had won the
Nobel Prize for physics at the age of 28. Men whose only work, she felt,
was extracting money from What had these men done in their whole lives that
could compare? What work, what benefit.

Zeretski had submitted his first paper to the Journal of Physics when he was
only sixteen and a student at the University of Budapest.  Shortly after, he was
recruited to Princeton University where he completed his Nobel prize winning
work on electronic transfer, which had led to the low cost electrification of
cities and towns throughout the country.

After winning the Nobel prize though, his scientific work had shifted in
the direction of the exotic. Having achieved success so early in life
without serious struggle or defeat, it seems he felt that nothing was
impossible. Or possibly with so little foundation he feared failing on a
less than grand task would expose. The common problems of the world were
too mundane for "The Great Zeretski" as had once been dubbed by the media.

With substantial financial backing, he had built a large laboratory in the
warehouse district of Manhattan with a staff which at its peak numbered 34.
And though his work was moderately successful, it had never lived up to his
promises. 

As his work produced more failures, his promises grew more outlandish. He
had taken to giving garish demonstrations that often included enormous
sparks and blasts of colorful smoke, boardering on theater. It was, as if
he felt it might be possible to conjure reality from well crafted make
believe. Over the years, he developed the reputation of a mad scientist,
but Judith was convinced that his most recent work, their work, was quite
real.

After the meeting, Jonson and Franklin met privately. "Do you think it is
possible that he has achieved what he claims" asked Jonson. "Well, if he
has, the potential is enormous." replied Franklin and added "Of course,
investing in him at this point could pose a serious risk to our
reputation." "We could try to keep it under wraps." replied Jonson.  "You
know that would never work with him and besides, even if it turns out that
is on to something, I suspect he would be a less than ideal business
partner. He is a bit of a public crank. We need to find out more about his
work and then get the opinion of people we trust. Then we can decide what
to do."

"Should I call Mueller?" asked Jonson. "Yes. Let's get him started with the
usual contract."

Stanley Mueller was a private detective who specialized in cases that paid.
He was not interested in tales of hard luck or in any sort of contingency
arrangement. While he looked the part by Hollywood standards, he was not
flashy or even particually clever. He was good at his job in a dull and
persistant sort of way. If you had cash and wanted information than Mueller
was your man. 

A few days after their meeting, Judith walked into the San Marco where she
came every Thursday evening to read a book and have a meal. Although the
San Marco was a lively restaurant with dancing and a band, it was a place
where the bartender and patrons usually left her alone.

This evening the club was more crowded than usual, but she found her usual
seat waiting for her at the end of the bar. After she sat down, the man
next to her offered to buy her a drink and without looking up she said "No
thanks", brought out her book and waited for the bartender to find her. 

The man asked her what she was reading. She named the author. He then
mentioned another author that she knew and then asked if she had read his
latest book. This was generally her que to leave, but then she turned and
saw a face more handsome than the ones that usually tried to get her
attention. She stopped and then she answered "Yes, she had."

She stayed and they talked about books. She found that he was not widely
read, but he showed a sincere interest in her opinions. He told her he was
a salesman for a regional electronics manufacturing company. She said she
worked as a scientific lab assistant. By the end of the evening, he was
even able to lure her off her perch and into the swirling crowd on the dance
floor. 

The next day the cliched emotions of a character from one of her novels
began to swim around in her head, but as soon as she focused on one, it
slipped away. All day these feelings where there and then gone. As if mere
observation was enough to disolve them. But observation was her stock and
trade and it was not in her nature to let go. It also did not help that
this was the focus of her work.

That same day Stanely Mueller was seated in Johnson's office explaining
that he had met the girl, and expected that within the next couple of weeks
he would be able get inside the lab and make time to copy the relavent
documents. Johnson said there was no real rush and that he didn't care to
know the details, but just to let him know when he had the material.

The following Saturday, she waited for him outside a new resturant in
mid-town. She was apprehesive, but had begun think of all this as just part
of her work. Seeing him reframed her thinking. What had become one side of
an equation in her head was now this handsome man walking toward her. He
smiled and greeted her and lead her into the resturant where he had
reserved a table.  During the evening they talked and laughed. Having no
previous buffer for these sorts of emotions, she was overwhelmed. 

They met the following Saturday at a new restaurant in mid-town. Over diner, he
said that he had always wanted to be a scientist, but could not afford to go to
college, so he had taken a wharehouse job and worked his way up to sales.  She
told him her story of how she got her job in the lab and then mentioned that
she worked for Zeretski. Mueller said that, as a kid, his heroes where all
scientists and that Zeretski was the one he admired most.

At the end of the evening on the way up to her apartment she thought about
Mueller and their conversation and she thought about the chance of meeting
someone who was interested in science and in her work and she lingered on these
thoughts till she fell into a troubled sleep.

For the next week and a half, Mueller tried to contact her, repeatedly calling
her apartment and leaving messages with the building's answering service. When
a week and half later she finally picked up the phone and said, "Hello" he was
taken a back. "I thought I might never reach you again." he said. "And I
thought you might never stop trying." She replied. She then apologized and said
that she was busy at work and getting home late each night, but agreed to meet
him the following Friday to see a show.

After the show, they walked together from the theater and talked. He noticed
that they seemed to be headed away from the crowds and into the warehouse
district where Zeretski had his lab. When they arrived at a nondescript door of
a nondescript building under a dim light, she asked "Would you like to come in
and see the lab?"

Mueller was impressed. The lab certainly lived up to its reputation.  She
showed him through rooms that contained glass cylinders with smoke pouring from
them, large metal columns emitting sparks, and various biological objects
suspended in sealed glass jars. Though many of the experiments gave the
impression that they had been running unattended for years.

As she led him into the main room, Mueller saw a space over two stories high.
Much of the walls were covered in thick electrical wires and what looked like
electrical transformer boxes giving the impression that whatever went on in
here, it needed a lot of power. In the middle of the room was a large machine
that seemed to be at the focus of everything.

[needs work]
Judith revealed that Zeretski's latest work was on the ability to control the
attraction between humans. She asked Mueller if he thought this was even
possible. He said, "To be honest, it seems a bit far fetched." "What makes you
think so?" She asked. "Well it seems that emotions are somewhat outside the
bounds of science." he said. "And from what base of knowledge do you draw your
understanding of the bounds of science?" she asked. "Well, just because I never
went to college, doesn't mean I don't have common sense." "Common sense" she
said expressing a sudden irritation, "What has common sense got to do with
anything?" 

"Listen" he said apologetically, and as she turned away from him he reached out
to stop her. She struggled to free herself saying "What are you doing? Let go
of me." "Wait, can't talk about this?" She dug her fingernails into his arm and
pulled him forward and as he lost his balance he fell against the machine in
the middle of the room. There was a loud crack and suddenly they were frozen
and awash in a blinding white light. And then, just as suddenly, the light was
gone.

As they left the lab and headed back toward the still bustling city night,
Mueller turned to her and said, "I have something to confess." She stopped and
turned toward him and holding both his hand, she smiled and said, "Save your
confessions for the priest, lets go get something to eat. I am suddenly feeling
famished."
