Mike,

I want to offer some advice. Whether or not it is good advice, I can't say,
but I hope it will at least provide some useful fodder.

I completely understand the temptation, but I would advice against telling
a student that they are going to fail. It is not that I care about their
feelings or that it is politically incorrect, it is simply that I think it
puts you at psychological disadvantage. Once a student feels there is no
hope they have no reason to try. 

I would find opportunities to tell students that they can make it i.e.
"You can become a professional welder." I would NOT say this in a way that
is meant to build confidence, i.e. a father telling his son "You can do
it!" I would NOT say this in way that is meant to imply that a task is
easier than expected i.e. "Anyone can do it." I would state it as a fact or
maybe even a threat. Essentially, you can do this. It is not going to be
easy. You are going to have to work hard. And if don't try that is on you,
i.e. your fault not mine. 

I would also emphasize that the only route to the this job is through you.
Learning to weld is not like learning to walk. The only way to learn is by
being taught. This is not a skill you can learn on the job. When a company
hires a welder, they want an experienced welder. Either you know how to
weld or not.

Emphasize you skills. The guys I trained are now making $K.
