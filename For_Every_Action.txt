As Captain Thomas Mackenzie sat alone on the ship's bridge and looked
out at the endless night, he thought about his long journey from a
rural village to the captain's bridge of a Federal Mining Explorer.
While he had not risen to as high a rank as others in his graduating
class at the academy, he had far surpassed the expectations for a boy
from a poor family with no political connections. His boyhood friends
all remained Earth-bound in jobs that rarely took them more than a few
miles from their homes.

His thoughts of home were interrupted by Corporal Cole's voice on the intercom
informing him that there was a problem with engine number two.  Mackenzie
glanced at the ship's navigation log and confirmed that they were still within
schedule for their estimated return path, but any problem this far from home was
a cause for concern.  Mining explorers were launched into space allowing only a
small margin for error.  Their own mission was esitmated to last exactly seventy
days from launch to landing. Any longer and the crew would arrive a little
hungry and possibly short of breath.  

Cole, the mission engineer, hung in the engine room holding the largest
spanner in her tool box, grease on her hands and Federal issue jumpsuit,
looking as macho as she possibly could suspended in zero gravity. She
stared at the fuel intake of engine number two as if to intimidate it into
reveling the cause of its malfunction. Having spent the past 45 minutes
trying to diagnose the trouble with the engine, she had finally, and
according to protocol, informed the Captain of the problem. 

Since mining explorer crews were limited to one engineer, their
training emphasized breadth over depth. They were primarily as problem
solvers, and Cole enjoyed solving problems, especially physical ones,
but she could also become easily frustrated by ones that seemed to
offer no leverage point, and she did not particularly like help,
especially when she was frustrated.

As Capt. Mackenzie entered the engine room, Cole remained focused on
the engine. "Do you know what the problem might be?" he asked. She
paused and then responded with a simple "No, Sir"  The problem is that
there is no problem. What do you mean. Everything checks. The fuel.
The pump. The regulator. It is as if our ship has simple decided to
stop obeying the laws of physics. She said as if giving up.

For every action there is an equal an opposite reaction said 

He began to think about the law and wondered what it really meant.

"That doesn't make any sense" said the Captain as
demonstrating either arrogance or ignorance in doubting
the laws of Sir Isaac Newton. As if he could.


And then, after
another pause, added that the number two engine was running at 10
percent of expected capacity. 

Finally, she turned to the Captain and said, "Apparently, 

She went back to quietly working on the engine and cursing at it under her
breath as she became more and more frustrated. 

After the Captain finished his questions, Cole returned to her conversation
with the malfunctioning engine which was more of one-sided argument. It was her
habit to talk to machines which exhibited seemingly (intractable problems), as if
the machines illogical behavior was very proof of a lurking consciousness.

As her frustration peaked, she said, "I don't get it, I don't get it! Your fuel
flow is correct, the compression is working, the thrust values check and yet
your acceleration is off ten percent! So, let's see, have you just decided to
ignore the laws of physics for the time being?" 

The tension, silently reverberating in the room, was broken by Lieutenant
William Wayne, who said "Newton's third law to be specific." Wayne, the ship's
mission scientist having come to check on the problem as well, then added "For
every action there is an equal and opposite reaction" and receiving no
response, continued, "The hot gasses move backward and the ship moves forward,
though as Cole has indicated, we may have found an exception."

The Captain, not certain how to respond, then addressed both Cole and Wayne
saying, "Well, I will be on the bridge if anyone needs me." Cole went back to
work on the engine minding Lieutenant Wayne's company far less than the
Captain's.

Life on explorers was not glamorous. In fact, the psychological demand of
dealing with boredom was their biggest challenge, one that Space Control had
yet to adequately address. The crew was only really necessary at during
launches, landings and on planet. The rest of the time, which was most of the
time, they mostly just waited while their ship carried them to and from their
destination.

The captain floated alone on the bridge confident in Cole's ability to find a
solution to the their problem. He recalled Wayne's remark as one of the
familiar proverbs from his high school science experience. He had always
enjoyed science and done well in it, but he never felt that he had the aptitude
for more serious study. 

He was surprised that he had never considered how the complexity of their
ship's entire propulsion system could be reduced to one simple law. He imagined
explaining this concept to his nephew back on Earth, who greatly admired his
uncle Mac the space explorer. But his nephew, with a child's naturally
recursive mind, kept asking why about every detail until doubt began to creep
into Macenzie's thoughts. Why do the action of gasses moving backward cause the
reaction of the ship to go forward? There seemed to be no connection between
the two events except the law that stated it was true. 

He checked the ships databases for answers, but found nothing more than
restatements of the same law. Unfortunately, the ship's databases were not very
complete as the obessive efficiency of space control extend to everything,
including bits of data, down the the last bit. Only including what was
necessary for a journey of 70 days.

The captain, certain that he must have missed something, called down to the
engine room and addressing Wayne asked "About your reference to Newton's 3rd
law of motion, I was just wondering if you could explain how the actions of the
gas cause the reaction of the ship"

Cole had become used to the Captain's almost embarrassingly blunt manner, but
at over one hundred thousand miles from Earth, facing mechanical problems and
was he seriously interested in the principles of high school physcis. Worse,
Had he really repeatedly launched himself into deep space without ever
wondering about how his ship got him there and back? 

"Why does the action of one object cause the reaction of another?" replied the
Captain. "Because it is a law of physics" replied Cole in a tone that barely
disguised her frustration. "That's no answer." said the Captain as if this were
simply a matter of fact, adding, "A law itself is not a reason." For a moment
no one spoke. Wayne looking at Cole, said to the Captain, "You seem to have a
point." Cole just shrugged her shoulders and said, "How am I supposed to know."

At that moment, the whole ship groaned and then became quiet. "What was that
noise?" came Mackenzie's voice over the intercom. "Or lack of noise" said
Wayne. "That was our entire propulsion system shutting down." said Cole turning
her attention to the now silent engines. "What happened?" asked Mackenzie
betraying a note of concern in his voice. Wayne responded, "I think we lost
faith, sir."  "What?" replied the captain. "It seems that we doubted Newton's
law right out of existence." replied Wayne. "That's nonsense" said the captain
in a puzzled tone. "Maybe" replied Wayne, "But for the moment it is the best
answer I've got." Everyone floated in silence.

A full shutdown was bad, very bad. And they weren't just in space, but 2.9
million miles from home. At their present speed, their spaceship would reach
Earth in about 25 years or 24 years after their oxygen was expected to run out.
They would become just another ghost ship litter in space, slowly and
dutifully carrying its long deceased crew back to Earth. 

Captain Mackenzie composed a message describing their situation and sent it off
to mission control. Looking out, he could imagine the message making its way
safely back to Earth in a matter of minutes. He wondered how their situation
would fair under the scrutiny of Space Control's cost benefit analysts. Would
they advise mission control to cut their losses? What could mission control do
anyway?

Twenty two hours later, the engine room had a disturbingly chaotic feel. Cole
was applying a strategy of divide and conquer to the malfunctioning engines,
isolating large system sections, testing them carefully, and then moving on to
smaller sub-sections. Wayne and Cole spoke very little. Instead Cole addressed
the engine directly, quietly continuing her one-sided debate. Her only
conversation with Wayne involved instructing him to move an engine part or help
with anything that required two hands.

While moving a large cooling pipe, Wayne without realizing it, hit Cole in the
head.  Cole who was standing closely behind him turned and pushed Wayne sharply
from behind, saying "Watch where you're going." "Hey, why did you hit me?" said
Wayne. "You hit me first." muttered Cole who had turned back to her task. Then
cracking a smile for the first time in more than a day, she said, "For every
action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." Wayne stood their rubbing his
shoulder and said, "Yes, but you hit me harder." Cole now turning to face Wayne
said, "Not possible, that would violate the laws of physics." "Assuming they
still apply." responded Wayne. 

Both Cole and Wayne sat down after working for past eighteen hours straight. Wayne
opened a package of the calorie bars that they had already begun to ration.  Cole
asked, "Do you really think we've passed into some mysterious realm beyond the reach
of Newton?" Wayne, just gave a short laugh. 

"Every action" Cole mused. "Does that mean that mean that every time I scratch my
butt, there is someone else un-scratching their butt?" "You scratch your butt?" asked
Wayne. "Well, only when I can't find someone to scratch it for me." said Cole. Wayne
smiled and said "Well, I guess Newton's law does not apply to butt scratching." "Or
probably, other bodily functions." responded Cole. 

"Well that seems to debunk the 'every action' portion of the law" said Wayne.  "For
some actions there is an equal and opposite reaction" does not sound like much of a
law said Cole. Both Wayne and Cole looked up as they noticed Captain Mackenzie, who
had been quietly standing at the door. "What bothers me is this notion that the
action and reaction are two distinct events" he added. "Does the gas leaving the ship
cause the ship to go forward or does the ship going forward cause the gas to leave
the ship?" "Sometimes there are actions and they are equal and opposite." said Cole.

"Well it seems that we are now even farther from solving the problem." said
Mackenzie. "What problem are you referring to, sir?" asked Cole. Mackenzie flustered
said, "Well, I think a better understanding of propulsion can only be to our
advantage." :wq

The captain checked his watch and contemplated how long it would keep working long
after lifesuport and run out.
