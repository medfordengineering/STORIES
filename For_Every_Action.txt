As Captain Thomas Mackenzie sat alone on the ship's bridge and looked out
at the endless night, he thought about his journey from a small rural
village to the bridge of a Federal Mining Explorer.  While he had not risen
to as high a rank as others in his graduating class at the academy, he had
far surpassed the expectations for a boy from a poor family with no
political connections. His boyhood friends all remained Earth-bound in jobs
that rarely took them more than a few miles from their homes.

His thoughts of home were interrupted by Corporal Cole's voice on the
intercom informing him that there was a problem with engine number two.
Mackenzie glanced at the ship's navigation log and confirmed that they were
still within the accepted schedule for their planned return path, but any
problem this far from home was a cause for concern.  Mining explorers were
launched into space allowing for only a small margin for error. Their
particular mission was set to last exactly seventy days from launch to
landing.  Any longer and the crew would arrive a little hungry and possibly
short of breath.  

Cole, the mission engineer, hung in the engine room holding the largest
spanner in her tool box with grease on her hands and Federal issue jumpsuit
and looking as macho as was possible suspended in zero gravity. She stared
at the fuel intake of engine number two as if to intimidate it into
revealing the cause of its malfunction. Having spent the past 45 minutes
trying to diagnose the trouble with the engine, she had finally, and
according to protocol, informed the Captain of the problem. 

Since mining explorer crews were limited to one engineer, her training
emphasized breadth over depth. Mining crew engineers were primarily problem
solvers, and Cole enjoyed solving problems, especially physical ones, but
she could also become easily frustrated by ones that seemed to offer no
leverage point, and she did not particularly like help, especially when she
was frustrated.

As Capt. Mackenzie entered the engine room, Cole remained focused on the
engine. "Do you know what the problem might be?" he asked. Without turning
she responded "No, Sir" and then added that the engine was running at 10
percent below capacity and she had not been able to figure out why.

As the Capt. stood there, she went back to her task which, for the moment
consisted of a one-sided argument with the engine. It was her habit to talk
to machines when they refused to work, as if illogical behavior was proof
of a lurking consciousness. 

As her frustration peaked, she shouted, "I don't get it, I don't get it,
fuel flow is correct, the compression is working, the thrust values check
and yet for some reason you have decided to reduce your acceleration by ten
percent!" and then with increasing sarcasm, "Maybe your just tired, in no
hurry to get back to Earth, huh?"

She turned back to the Capt., and in a voice that did not betray her
exasperation said, "As you can see, the engine is working properly with the
one small exception that it is not working properly. The problem is that
there is no problem."

"It is as if the engine decided to stop obeying the laws of physics" said
William Wayne, the ship's mission scientist and third member of the crew
who was now in the doorway curious about the commotion.

Life on a mining explorer was mostly dull. In fact, the psychological
demand of dealing with boredom was a crew's biggest challenge, one that
Space Control had yet to adequately address. The crew was only really
necessary at during launches, landings and on planet. The rest of the time,
which was most of the time, they mostly waited while their ship carried
them to and from their destinations. 

Cole just rolled her eyes and turned back to the engine. The Capt. turned
to Lt. Wayne and asked, "What do you mean?" 

"Oh just that according to Newton's Third law of physics, for every action
there must be an equal and opposite reaction. If the engine is correctly
burning fuel, the action, then the rocket must accelerate proportionally,
the corresponding reaction." Said Wayne.

The captain considered Wayne's comment seriously, and then not certain how
to respond, addressed both Cole and Wayne saying, "Well, I will be on the
bridge if anyone needs me." Cole went back to work on the engine minding
Lieutenant Wayne's company far less than the Captain's.

The captain floated alone on the bridge confident in Cole's ability to find
a solution to the their problem, but he could not seem to get Wayne's
comment out of his mind. Why had he brought up a law of physics last
learned in high school? Surely there was no way this could aid in
understanding the problem they were facing on the ship. 

His mind wandered and he thought about how their entire propulsion system,
what had brought them over a million miles into space, could be reduced to
one simple law. It surprised him that he had never considered this
perspective before.  

He imagined explaining this concept to his young nephew Max back on Earth.
Max was his only sister's only son and she, like the rest of his family,
continued to live in the same town where Mackenzie was born. Mackenzie, as
a space explorer, was a hero to Max. But as Mackenzie rehearsed the
conversation in his mind, Max with a child's naturally recursive mind, kept
asking why until doubt began to creep into MacKenzie's own thoughts. Why do
the action of gasses moving backward out of the ship cause the reaction of
the ship to go forward? The gases certainly moved backward out of the ship.
Of that he was certain and this resulted from constant burning and
resulting expansion of gasses. That the ship moved forward was also
certain. But there seemed to be no connection between the two events except
the law that stated one existed. Why would gases moving backward cause the
rocket to move forward? Was the relationship even causal or just some
unknown but observable magic in the universe.

He checked the ships databases for answers, but found nothing more than
restatements of the same law and question-begging explanations.
Unfortunately, the ship's databases were limited to exactly what Space
Control considered necessary for their mission. Although the weight of data
was almost insignificant with respect to weight of their ship, efficiency
was observed down to the last byte of data.

This problem began to consume the captain's thoughts and no mater how he
view the problem, no answer was forthcoming. Finally, certain that he must
have missed some part of the explanation, he made his way down to the
engine room to find Lt. Wayne still there silently watching Cole work.
Entering the room he said, he had been thinking about Wayne's comment, but
did not quite understand how Newton's law explained the propulsion of their
ship. 

Cole had become used to the Captain's almost embarrassingly sincere manner,
but was he really admitting that he had launched himself into deep space
over half a dozen times without ever once wondering how his ship got him
there and back? And more importantly, why was he even focused on this
problem which had no baring on the more important problem of getting
themselves back to Earth.

"Why does the action of one object cause the reaction of another?" asked
the Captain. "Because it is a law of physics" replied Cole without looking
up from her work and in a tone that barely disguised her annoyance.  "But
that does not answer the question." said the Captain with no more emotion
than if this were simply a matter of fact. He then added, "A law itself is
not a reason." For a moment no one spoke.  Wayne said to the Captain,
"Well, I never really thought about it that much. I guess you have a
point." They both looked at Cole who just shrugged her shoulders and said,
"How am I supposed to know."

At that moment, the whole ship groaned and then became quiet. "What was
that noise?" asked the Captain? "Or more importantly lack of noise" said
Cole. "That was our entire propulsion system shutting down." she added,
turning her attention to the now silent engines. "What happened?" asked
Mackenzie betraying a note of concern in his voice. Cole ignored him and
immediately went to work trying to revive the engine. Wayne just responded,
"I think we lost faith."  "What?" replied the captain. "It seems that we
doubted Newton's law right out of existence." replied Wayne. "That's
nonsense" said the captain in a puzzled tone. "Maybe" replied Wayne, "But
for the moment it is the best answer I've got." Everyone floated in
silence.

A full shutdown in space was bad, very bad. And they weren't just in space,
but 2.9 million miles from home. At their present speed without
acceleration, their spaceship would reach Earth in about 25 years or 24
years after their oxygen was expected to run out. They would become just
another one of the ghost ships that littering space, slowly and dutifully
returning their long deceased crew back to Earth. 

Back on the bridge, Captain Mackenzie composed a message describing their
situation and sent it off to mission control. Looking out, he could imagine
the message making its way safely back to Earth in a matter of minutes. He
wondered how their situation would fair under the scrutiny of Space
Control's cost benefit analysts. Would they advise mission control to cut
their losses? What could mission control do anyway?

Twenty two hours later, the engine room looked more like a repair shop with
engine parts everywhere. Under the premise of desparation, Cole had
dismanteled most of the engine and was methodically testing each individual
section before moving on to the next.  Wayne and Cole spoke very little.
Instead Cole addressed the engine directly, quietly continuing her
one-sided debate. Her only conversation with Wayne involved instructing him
to move an engine part or help with anything that required two hands.

While moving a large cooling pipe, Wayne without realizing it, hit Cole in the
head.  Cole who was standing closely behind him turned and pushed Wayne sharply
from behind, saying "Watch where you're going." "Hey, why did you hit me?" said
Wayne. "You hit me first." muttered Cole who had turned back to her task. Then
cracking a smile for the first time in more than a day, she said, "For every
action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." Wayne stood their rubbing his
shoulder and said, "Yes, but you hit me harder." Cole now turning to face Wayne
said, "Not possible, that would violate the laws of physics." "Assuming they
still apply." responded Wayne. 

Both Cole and Wayne sat down after working for past eighteen hours straight. Wayne
opened a package of the calorie bars that they had already begun to ration.  Cole
asked, "Do you really think we've passed into some mysterious realm beyond the reach
of Newton?" Wayne, just gave a short laugh. 

"Every action" Cole mused. "Does that mean that mean that every time I scratch my
butt, there is someone else un-scratching their butt?" "You scratch your butt?" asked
Wayne. "Well, only when I can't find someone to scratch it for me." said Cole. Wayne
smiled and said "Well, I guess Newton's law does not apply to butt scratching." "Or
probably, other bodily functions." responded Cole. 

"Well that seems to debunk the 'every action' portion of the law" said Wayne.  "For
some actions there is an equal and opposite reaction" does not sound like much of a
law said Cole. Both Wayne and Cole looked up as they noticed Captain Mackenzie, who
had been quietly standing at the door. "What bothers me is this notion that the
action and reaction are two distinct events" he added. "Does the gas leaving the ship
cause the ship to go forward or does the ship going forward cause the gas to leave
the ship?" "Sometimes there are actions and they are equal and opposite." said Cole.

"Well it seems that we are now even farther from solving the problem." said
Mackenzie. "What problem are you referring to, sir?" asked Cole. Mackenzie flustered
said, "Well, I think a better understanding of propulsion can only be to our
advantage." :wq

The captain checked his watch and contemplated how long it would keep working long
after lifesuport and run out.
