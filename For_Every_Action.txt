As Captain Thomas Mackenzie sat alone on the ship's bridge and looked out
at the endless night, he thought about his journey from a small rural
village to the command of a Federal Mining Explorer.  While he had not
risen to as high a rank as others in his graduating class at the academy,
he had far surpassed the expectations for a boy from a poor and rural
family with no political connections. His boyhood friends all remained
Earth-bound in jobs that rarely took them more than a few miles from their
homes.

His thoughts of home were interrupted by Corporal Cole's voice on the
intercom informing him that there was a problem with engine number two.
Mackenzie instinctively glanced at the ship's navigation log and confirmed
that they were still within the margin of error for their planned return
path, but any problem this far from home was a cause for concern.  Mining
explorers were launched into space allowing for only a small margin for
error. Their particular mission was set to last seventy days from launch to
landing. Any longer and the crew could arrive a little hungry and possibly
short of breath.  

Cole, the mission engineer, hung in the engine room holding the largest
spanner in her tool box with grease on her hands and Federal-issue jumpsuit
and looking as macho as was possible suspended in zero gravity. She stared
at the fuel intake control of engine number two as if to intimidate it into
revealing the cause of its malfunction. Having spent the past 45 minutes
trying to diagnose the trouble with the engine, she had finally, and
according to protocol, informed the Captain of the problem. 

Since mining explorer crews were limited to one engineer, her training
emphasized breadth over depth. Mining crew engineers were primarily problem
solvers, and Cole enjoyed solving problems, especially physical ones, but
she could also become easily frustrated by ones that seemed to offer no
point of leverage, and she did not particularly like help, especially when
she was frustrated.

As Capt. Mackenzie entered the engine room, Cole remained focused on the
engine. "Any idea what the problem might be?" he asked. Without turning she
responded "No, Sir" and then added that the engine was running at 10
percent below capacity though she had not been able to figure out why.

As the Capt. stood there, she went back to her task, which for the moment
consisted of a one-sided argument with the engine. It was her habit to talk
to machines when they refused to work as they were supposed to work, as if
their illogical behavior was proof of a lurking consciousness. As her
frustration peaked, she grumbled loudly, "Arggg! Why aren't you working!"
her fist tightly clenched around the spanner which she imagined using to
beat the engine into obedience, "I guess you're just tired, no hurry to get
back to Earth, huh?" she sighed a long breath.

She turned back to the Capt., resigned to him standing there watching her,
and said, "All I can say is that, the engine is working properly with the
one small exception that it is not working properly. It appears to be
burning fuel at the correct burn-rate and the exhaust flow readings are
correct for the burn-rate. The problem is..." She shook her head "that
there is no problem."

"Maybe it decided to stop obeying the laws of physics" said William Wayne,
the ship's mission scientist and third member of the crew who was now in
the engine room doorway curious about the commotion.

Life on a mining explorer was for the most part excruciatingly dull. The
psychological demand of dealing with boredom was a crew's biggest
challenge, one that United Space Control had yet to adequately address. The
crew was only really necessary during launches, landings and on surface.
The rest of the time, which was most of the time, they just waited while
their ship carried them to and from their destination. 

TRIED SLEEP BUT DID NOT WORK

Cole just rolled her eyes and turned back to the engine. The Capt. turned
to Lt. Wayne and asked, "What do you mean?" expressing more sincerity than
the comment warranted.

"Oh, uh...just trying to inject a little humor into the situation." Wayne
smiled. The Capt. looked at Wayne trying to make sense of this response.
Filling the silence Wayne added "Well, it is just that according to
Newton's Third law of physics, for every action there must be an equal and
opposite reaction. If the engine is correctly burning fuel, the action,
then the rocket must accelerate proportionally, the corresponding
reaction." and then adding "and apparently, well, according to Cole's
description, that is no longer necessarily the case."

The captain narrowed his brows as he considered Wayne's response. He then
said, "Yes, well." Turning now to address Cole he said, "I will be on the
bridge writing up a report if anyone needs me." Cole continued working on
the engine minding Lieutenant Wayne's company somewhat less than the
Captain's.

The captain floated alone on the bridge confident in Cole's ability to find
a solution to the their problem. Cole had been assigned to his command a
year ago, after the captain had accepted a promotion from Chief Officer to
Captain which came with a transfer from intra-orbit shipping to mining
exploration. Assignments in mining exploration were generally not coveted
because of their increased risk and extensive time in flight, but they paid
well and were a good way to get promotions.

As a new captain, he did not have a lot of choice regarding his crew and he
could have done a lot worse. Cole had received a perfect score on the
technical portion of her exams, a rare feat on any of the five areas of
examination which, along with assessing technical skills, tested everything
from physical endurance to social compatibility.  

short for Collette.

Although they had spent more than 3000 hours living together in close
quarters over the past year, he would not say they were exactly close
friends. They did not socialize outside of missions and did not socialize
much during missions. Their daily routine, which rarely varied, offered
little fodder for conversation. Though, Mackenzie assumed she liked him or,
at least, enjoyed his company since, as far as he knew, she had not put in
for a transfer. 

He found his relationship with Wayne more difficult. It was their first
mission together. His former science officer had recently retired. Wayne
was a pleasant enough person, but he felt that he could never quite
understand what Wayne was getting at, and yet, he always seemed to be
getting at something. 

The Captain began preparing the mandatory report that once sent would take
25 minutes to reach earth and at least a half hour to process before being
sent back. The returning message would carry little useful information. It
was a ritual of communication carried over from when space travel could
still be measured in thousands of miles above Earth, and ships could, in
real time, work through a problem with Space Control, but at over a million
miles from home there was no longer any meaningful connection. 

What was it that bothered him about Wayne, he thought? He knew his comment
was not to be taken seriously. He noticed his mind wandering. It was a
frustrating habit that he seemed to only have been exacerbated by time
spent on endurance flights. He tried to refocus on writing his report, but
there was little incentive. What could Command do? It would have been a
different story had the problem occurred on the advance portion of their
trip. Depending their distance from Earth Command could request a return.
But at this stage they were already trying to return as fast as they could.

"For every action, there is an equal an opposite reaction." He said to
himself and recalled learning this exact mantra in high school physics.
But what exactly did that mean. He turned to the ship's computer and looked
up Newton's laws of physics. There it was Newton's third law, stated just
as Wayne had quoted. It included a description of how when a person sits on
a chair the person exerts a downward force and the chair exerts an upward
force and he remembered being just as confused by this as he was in high
school. 

He remembered doing well in physics though. He was good with equations. He
remembered the example of a cannon that his teacher had provided. The ball
went forward and the cannon when back. At least this example made more
sense to him. He had experienced recoil growing up in the country and using
rifles. The problem with the rocket seemed a bit more subtle, but he knew
the gases acted as the ball might, just lots of small balls instead of one
large one moving backward.  His rocket was just the giant recoil of a gun.

His thoughts now drifted to his nephew, his only sister's nine year old son
Max. Max was a lot like him. He liked science and was good at it. Max was
proud of his uncle, the great space explorer. He had already decided that
he wanted to follow in his footsteps and become a space explorer as well.

He found himself explaining to Max the principles of rocket travel,
describing the hot gases moving backward propelled the rocket forward with
enough force escape the pull of Earth and to travel millions of miles
through space. He quoted Netwon's principle and emphasized the importance
of doing well in physics class. 

But Max, possessing the naturally recursive of a child, kept asking why
"Why do the gasses cause the ship to move forward?" "Well, that is one of
the three basic law of physics, discovered by the Issac Newton, the father
of classical physics.  Even with everything we have learned, those three
laws still apply today." "But how does that work?" "Well as I said, the
gasses are propelled out of the rear of the spaceship and so the ship moves
forward...it is the basic...a law..." 

His thoughts trailed off. His conversation interrupted...Suddenly he was
stuck and back on board. How exactly did the hot gasses move the ship
forward or the bullet move the gun backward for that matter? He could think
of no real connection between the two events. It was true that the hot
gasses left the ship at great speed and it was certainly true that the ship
moved forward. But why?

Just because one object moved backward, why would another object need to
move forward and why would these two motions need to equate. Was there some
sort of universal conservation of direction. And if so, why? He imagined
all sorts of pairs of objects that did or did not behave in this manner.
The rule seemed far from universal. "For every action" he thought but what
constituted an action? 

In space this was easy to test. He could throw a moderately heavy object
forward and his body responded by moving in the other direction, but again,
why?  xx more he thought about it the more frustrated he became. Here he
was the Captain of an space explorer and yet he could not even explain how
he had gotten himself a million miles from home.

He forced himself to finish the report. The answer would come to him, it
would just take time. After he sent the report, he continued to work
through his series of daily system checks and tasks. Each day pressure
valves and seals were tested. Temperatures and volumes were recorded.
Switches were set and cleared. Tasks that could, for the most part, have
been handled more efficiently by a machine or computer, but there were
humans on board who, for the most part, had nothing better to do. It was
widely accepted but never officially stated that these tasks were simply a
way to keep the crew occupied and, more importantly, sane.

In addition to daily tasks, there were system checks to be followed for
just about every possible scenario including partial engine failure. As
captain of the ship he was required to memorize an entire operations
flowchart complete with thousands of conditions and loops and that filled a
230 page manual.

In reality most captains studied enough to pass the test and soon forgot
most of the material. Mackenzie prided himself on his memory, but still
consulted the manual when faced with uncommon events.

After more than an hour he had not heard from Cole and so he made his way
down to the engine room to find Lt. Wayne still there silently watching
Cole work. Their silence gave him the uneasy sense that they had been
talking about him before he arrived. He asked Cole if she had been able to
figure out what was wrong with the engine. She said no turning to address
him and seeming somewhat more resigned to difficult. 

Either way she should have reported in to him fifteen minutes ago. He
wondered why she had not followed protocol, but advised himself,
reluctantly, that he should not push this point at the moment.

Cole went back to work. Wayne smiled at the Captain. The Captain returned
the smile. Almost a minute passed. "I'm still waiting for the response from
Command." Mackenzie said. Cole made a slight "hmm." Wayne said nothing. The
Captain became aware of the usual hum of the ship as all of its systems
tirelessly performed their duty with precision but without complaint and
without exhaustion. Moving gases and liquids..pumped, signals. At least
everything sounded in order, he thought.

"I guess the action and reaction are still not working." The Captain
attempted. Wayne looked at him confused for a second. "What you said
about.." The Captain started. "Right" Wayne interrupted. "Well I was just
kidding." he continued. "Of course." said the captain.

"It's odd" the Captain started. "I can't recall exactly why that law works.
I mean, I had no problem with high school physics of course, it is just
that I seem to have forgotten the exact science behind the cause and
effect." 

Cole laughed to herself. She had become used to the Captain's almost
embarrassingly sincere manner, but was he really admitting that he had
launched himself into deep space over half a dozen times without ever once
wondering how his ship got him there and back? And more importantly, why
the hell did he care given that they had slightly more pressing problems at
the moment. "It is a law of physics." Cole responded bluntly over her work
as if this were enough to settle the question. Revealing exasperation in
her voice.

"Right." The captain paused. And here is where he ignored the voice that
usually guided him around the potential pitfalls of human interaction. "But
that does not really answer the question." "To put it bluntly, There
appears no connection between the one object's action and the second
object's reaction."  He then added, "A law itself is not a reason." Wayne,
calling on his own memory of physics class said, "Well, it is like a cannon
and a cannon ball. When the cannon is fired, the cannon ball is projected
out of the cannon, but the cannon also moves backward. It recoils. The
rocket..." "Yes. I know." The Captain interrupted. "But that does not
explain why." Wayne, not sure himself, just said. "Huh, well I guess you
have a point."

They both looked at Cole who just shook her head and said, "How am I
supposed to know." gritting teeth?

At that moment, the whole ship rocked and groaned slightly and a hum that
had played constant in the background became quiet. "What was that noise?"
asked the Captain.  "That noise *was* the sound of our propulsion system
which just completely shut down." "What happened?" asked the Captain. No
one answered. Then Wayne said, "Maybe we lost faith." "What?" replied the
captain.  "Maybe we doubted Newton's law right out of existence." "That's
nonsense" said the captain in a puzzled tone. "Maybe" replied Wayne, "But
for the moment it is the best answer I've got." Everyone floated in
silence.

A full shutdown in space was bad, very bad. And they weren't just in space,
but 2.9 million miles from home. There was no concern about their reaching
Earth. They were headed straight for Earth, but at their present speed
without acceleration, their spaceship would reach Earth in about 25 years
or 24 years after their oxygen was expected to run out. They would become
just another ghost ship, slowly and dutifully returning its long deceased
crew back home.

Both the Captain and Wayne looked at Cole. While the manual would have
offered two or at most three options for dealing with this sort of extreme
emergency and the decision as to which option to follow lay in the hands of
the Captain, there was no question about who would be deciding their next
course of action.

"Over the next 36 hours we need to run a strip down diagnostic of the
entire engine. Wherever this gremlin is hiding Hard to hide. Assuming we
find the problem and we have the necessary materials to make the repair, we
will then try to make the repair as soon as possible. I am going to need
help so we will run split shifts of eight hours on four hours off." Leaving
nothing to chance, or human intuition, Command had determined that split
shifts which included sleep were more efficient than teams working extended
hours without sleep. Even when time was critical. "Agreed?" she nodded
toward the captain. "Yes, of course." the captain responded in a way that
he hoped he had retained authority. "Wayne and I will take the first
shift." 

The Captain headed back up to his quarters. He would get some sleep. He was
concerned about their predicament but not enough to lose sleep. If there
was one thing that Command got right, it was identifying and selecting
astronauts who stayed cool under pressure. He could think about the danger
they faced, but he could not get himself worked up about it. And this only
added to his sense that maybe there was something wrong with him. Other
things bothered him, just not this. His mind replayed his last conversation
with his crew. He carefully rewrote his part until the scene ended with him
sounding satisfyingly assertive. 

Cole took a deep breath. When it came to danger, she preferred the known to
the unknown, and from her perspective, most of life, with the exception of
these sorts of moments, consisted of perpetual unknown danger. Now that she
had accepted the gravity of the problem, there was merely the process of
following the steps required to address it. They would methodically work
through the engine control system at a fine enough scale, that no matter
how small whatever gremlin was hiding in there would be revealed.

Wayne floated waiting for instruction. Cole handed him a simple current
meter and had him test and record readings across over a hundred points
inside a large panel that she had exposed. Basic mechanical and electrical
training was required for all deep space crew members. At first they did
not speak as Wayne became familiar with his new task.

"He's a bit of an odd bird." Wayne suggested to Cole. "Hmm" responded Cole
immersed in her own task. A few minutes later Wayne asked, "So what do you
think of him?" "What?" Cole responded clearly indicating that she had not
been paying attention to him. "Captain MacKenzie?" she added wondering
where this was going. "I don't know. He does his job. I do mine." she
paused, "He has always gotten me back to Earth." recognizing the irony as
she spoke.




If he were a robot he would understand physics. Would he need to look
things up. How else to be human. But to want to be human. What is more
human than to regret our adaquit to want to be a machine. Do you want to be
a machine? No.
In the back of everyone's mind was the need to resolve the problem in 48
hours. This flight disable survival window. While it varried for every
mission, it was generally accepted rule of thumb that a flight could delay
its schedule no more than 48 hours. So all serious problems had to be
resolved in that time frame. 

As the worked reminded Wayne of watching his father work on transports back
home when he was young. His father never asked him to help and he had
little intererest anyway. Cole described her own experience working on
farming equipment as a teenager. Her father had died when she was young and
she had starting helping the family from an early age. 

The result of the emergency proceedures was that the ship became less
comfortable, less cool, less dry, less breathable. After the captain left,
Wayne said, "He is a bit of an odd duck." One of the cardinal rules of
long-term flights was not to disparage another crew member behind their
back, but it was rarel followed. Cole responded with only a mild "yeah".
Wayne than asked whether she had ever spent time with him outside of
flight, what she knew about his family... 

After three hours of work they stopped to wait for their last test to
complete. Each of them broke out a small portion of rations. This was
against the emegency rationing plan but they knew that staying alert and
well-fed during the process was more important. There was something that
bugged Wayne about the captain. Something that did not seem right and he
wanted Cole to share his feeling. He wanted to confirm his sense of the
world. Finally he asked, "Do you think Captain Mckenzie is an android?"
Okay, what I mean is he an android?

This stopped Cole. She had not enjoyed his questions about the Captain and
she did not enjoy his. "What do you mean she asked?" as if the question
itself were absurd. 

Over the past thirty years, robots had taken on more complex and human-like
tasks, but to this point they were still mechanical and biomechanical
devices that could perform some human tasks but that could hardly be
mistaken for human.  The two fields of pure robotics building up from
scratch and bio-robotics starting with lifeforms and exerting more and more
control over their behavior. The field of computing had produced impressive
software that had long surpassed the understanding of the individuals who
iniated the software. 

The ones revealed to the public had been relatively easily distinguished
from their human counterparts, but the science was advancing rapidly and
rumors of more and more advanced versions existed.

"It is just that he has got no sense of humor." said Wayne. "And so you
immediately assume he is robot just because he does not laugh at your
jokes?"  "It's not that...he just seems odd and unemotional." "Well, he is
not an android. I have known him for years. And besides, I don't believe
the rumors about the goverment making humans better than humans." 

"Well it is crazy." she said. "I have know him for three years. He is not
an android." "Well, it just seems like a possiblity."  "So you believe the
rumors about the government making humans better than humans?" "It seems
likely." he said trying to bolster his argument by refering to scientific
journals from his own research. 

"Well he has a family. So unless they have figured out how to make robots
have kids, you may need to rethink your theory." "How do you know he has
a family?" Wayne asked. Cole just looked at Wayne feeling annoyed. Why was
he bringing this all up now, she thought. Changing the subject she said,
"We need to start checking the forward compression system." Wayne followed
Cole provided assistance.

An hour later, Capt. Mackenzie came into the engine room. Twelve hours has
passed since complete engine shut down. The warning lights continued to
flash. The fourty eight hour clock showed 36 hours left. So far they had
all remained calm. Mackenzie asked if there was any news? Cole looked over
and was tempted to say, "Only that Wayne here thinks you are a robot." But
instead said, "We have completed base tests and have found no fault. We are
now just finishing our tests on the forward compression." She gave no sign
of hope because there was no sign to give. But she remained confident that
a solution would be found and in time. The captain looked over at Wayne who
returned his glance without saying anything. The captain then asked Wayne
if he had any thoughts about the matter. Wayne said that he did not.

The capt. said he could be reached if they needed him. 

Suddenly Cole stopped. "Test that again." she said. "What do you mean?"
"Hold the probe next to the heat section." "This is failing." "What does
htta mean." :w













Back on the bridge, Captain Mackenzie composed a message describing their
situation and sent it off to mission control. Looking out, he could imagine
the message making its way safely back to Earth in a matter of minutes. He
wondered how their situation would fair under the scrutiny of Space
Control's cost benefit analysts. Would they advise mission control to cut
their losses? What could mission control do anyway?

Twenty two hours later, the engine room looked more like a repair shop with
engine parts everywhere. Under the premise of desparation, Cole had
dismanteled most of the engine and was methodically testing each individual
section before moving on to the next.  Wayne and Cole spoke very little.
Instead Cole addressed the engine directly, quietly continuing her
one-sided debate. Her only conversation with Wayne involved instructing him
to move an engine part or help with anything that required two hands.




While moving a large cooling pipe, Wayne without realizing it, hit Cole in the
head.  Cole who was standing closely behind him turned and pushed Wayne sharply
from behind, saying "Watch where you're going." "Hey, why did you hit me?" said
Wayne. "You hit me first." muttered Cole who had turned back to her task. Then
cracking a smile for the first time in more than a day, she said, "For every
action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." Wayne stood their rubbing his
shoulder and said, "Yes, but you hit me harder." Cole now turning to face Wayne
said, "Not possible, that would violate the laws of physics." "Assuming they
still apply." responded Wayne. 

Both Cole and Wayne sat down after working for past eighteen hours straight. Wayne
opened a package of the calorie bars that they had already begun to ration.  Cole
asked, "Do you really think we've passed into some mysterious realm beyond the reach
of Newton?" Wayne, just gave a short laugh. 

"Every action" Cole mused. "Does that mean that mean that every time I scratch my
butt, there is someone else un-scratching their butt?" "You scratch your butt?" asked
Wayne. "Well, only when I can't find someone to scratch it for me." said Cole. Wayne
smiled and said "Well, I guess Newton's law does not apply to butt scratching." "Or
probably, other bodily functions." responded Cole. 

"Well that seems to debunk the 'every action' portion of the law" said Wayne.  "For
some actions there is an equal and opposite reaction" does not sound like much of a
law said Cole. Both Wayne and Cole looked up as they noticed Captain Mackenzie, who
had been quietly standing at the door. "What bothers me is this notion that the
action and reaction are two distinct events" he added. "Does the gas leaving the ship
cause the ship to go forward or does the ship going forward cause the gas to leave
the ship?" "Sometimes there are actions and they are equal and opposite." said Cole.

"Well it seems that we are now even farther from solving the problem." said
Mackenzie. "What problem are you referring to, sir?" asked Cole. Mackenzie flustered
said, "Well, I think a better understanding of propulsion can only be to our
advantage." :wq
:wq

The captain checked his watch and contemplated how long it would keep working long
after lifesuport and run out.
