As Captain Thomas Mackenzie sat alone on the ship's bridge and looked out
at the endless night, he thought about his journey from a small rural
village to the commmand of a Federal Mining Explorer.  While he had not
risen to as high a rank as others in his graduating class at the academy,
he had far surpassed the expectations for a boy from a poor family with no
political connections. His boyhood friends all remained Earth-bound in jobs
that rarely took them more than a few miles from their homes.

His thoughts of home were interrupted by Corporal Cole's voice on the
intercom informing him that there was a problem with engine number two.
Mackenzie glanced at the ship's navigation log and confirmed that they were
still within the accepted schedule for their planned return path, but any
problem this far from home was a cause for concern.  Mining explorers were
launched into space allowing for only a small margin for error. Their
particular mission was set to last exactly seventy days from launch to
landing.  Any longer and the crew would arrive a little hungry and possibly
short of breath.  

Cole, the mission engineer, hung in the engine room holding the largest
spanner in her tool box with grease on her hands and Federal-issue jumpsuit
and looking as macho as was possible suspended in zero gravity. She stared
at the fuel intake of engine number two as if to intimidate it into
revealing the cause of its malfunction. Having spent the past 45 minutes
trying to diagnose the trouble with the engine, she had finally, and
according to protocol, informed the Captain of the problem. 

Since mining explorer crews were limited to one engineer, her training
emphasized breadth over depth. Mining crew engineers were primarily problem
solvers, and Cole enjoyed solving problems, especially physical ones, but
she could also become easily frustrated by ones that seemed to offer no
leverage point, and she did not particularly like help, especially when she
was frustrated.

As Capt. Mackenzie entered the engine room, Cole remained focused on the
engine. "Do you know what the problem might be?" he asked. Without turning
she responded "No, Sir" and then added that the engine was running at 10
percent below capacity though she had not been able to figure out why.

As the Capt. stood there, she went back to her task which, for the moment,
consisted mostly of a one-sided argument with the engine. It was her habit
to talk to machines when they refused to work as expected, as if illogical
behavior was proof of a lurking consciousness. 

As her frustration peaked, she grumbled loudly, "Arggg!  I don't get it, I
just don't get it!" her fist tightly clenched around the spanner as if she
might resort to beating the engine into obedience and then addressing the
malfunctioning engine, "I guess you're just tired, no hurry to get back to
Earth, huh?"

She turned back to the Capt., resigned to him standing there watching, and
said, "All I can say is that, the engine is working properly with the one
small exception that it is not working properly. It appears to be burning
fuel at the correct burn-rate and the exhaust appears functional. The
problem is that there is no problem."

"It is as if the engine decided to stop obeying the laws of physics" said
William Wayne, the ship's mission scientist and third member of the crew
who was now in the engine room doorway curious about the commotion.

Life on a mining explorer was mostly dull. In fact, the psychological
demand of dealing with boredom was a crew's biggest challenge, one that
United Space Control had yet to adequately address. The crew was only
really necessary at during launches, landings and on planet. The rest of
the time, which was most of the time, they just waited while their ship
carried them to and from their destinations. 

Cole just rolled her eyes and turned back to the engine. The Capt. turned
to Lt. Wayne and asked, "What do you mean?" expressing more sincerity than
the comment warrented.

"Oh just trying to inject a little humor into the situation." The Capt.
looked at Wayne with a furrowed brow trying to make sense of his response.
After an awkward pause, Wayne added "Well, it is just that according to
Newton's Third law of physics, for every action there must be an equal and
opposite reaction. If the engine is correctly burning fuel, the action,
then the rocket must accelerate proportionally, the corresponding
reaction." adding "and apparently that is not the case."

The captain looked at Wayne and considered his comment, and then not
certain how to respond, addressed both Cole and Wayne saying, "Well, I will
be on the bridge writing up a report if anyone needs me." Cole continued
working on the engine minding Lieutenant Wayne's company far less than the
Captain's.

The captain floated alone on the bridge confident in Cole's ability to find
a solution to the their problem. Cole had been assigned to his command
three years ago, after McKenzie had accepted a transfer from intra-orbit
shiping to mining exploration. As a new captain, he did not have a lot of
choice regarding his crew and he could have done a lot worse. She had
received a perfect score on the techincal portion of her exams, a rare feat
on any of the eight areas of examination which along with assessing
technical skills tested everything from physical endurance to social
compatibility.  

"Robots? who is a robot? how do they find out"

Although they had spent more than 2000 hours living continuously in close
quarters, he would not say they were exactly friends. Long-voyage space
crews tended to not be very social. Since very little happened during their
flights there was very little fodder for new conversation. He assumed she
enjoyed his company since, as far as he knew, she had not put in for a
transfer. 

He found Wayne more problematic. It was their first mission together. His
former science officer had retired. He felt that he could never quite
understand what Wayne was getting at and yet he always seemed to be getting
at something. He also felt that Wayne was making his relationship with Cole
more difficult.

He would repair a report that would take 25 minutes to reach earth and at
least a few hours to process. Sometimes days. It would be sent back with
little useful information. There was little they could do though they
pretended?? 

His thoughts turned to Wayne's comment. The last person he heard talk about
Newton's laws of physics was his high school physics teacher. What was
Wayne getting at? He often said he was joking but It certainly did not seem
like humor. His thoughts dirfted to his newphew, his only sister's nine
year old son Max. 

He enjoyed spending time with Max when he was on Earth. Max was proud of
his uncle, the the great space explorer. Max had already decided that he
wanted to be a space explorer like his uncle, and he had performed well on
his initial exams.

Mackenzie imagined talking with Max about the science of space flight and
how it was all based on a simple principle of physics and how the action of
the hot gasses moving backward resulted in the opposite action of the space
ship moving forward. And how with little friction or gravity it was quite
simple to move his ship millions of miles through space.

Max's naturally recursive eight-year-old mind kept asking Mackenzie to
explain the science. "Why do the gasses cause the ship to move forward?"
"Well, that is a basic law of physics, discovered by the Issac Newton, the
father of clasical physics. Even with everything we have learned, it is
still a basic law that applies today." "But how does that work?" "Well as I
said, the gasses are propelled out of the rear of the spaceship and so the
ship moves forward.." His imagined conversation trailed off as he began to
think about exactly how the hot gasses moved the ship forward. He could
think of no connection between the two events.

He consulted the ships library but little more than what he remembered from
his high school physics book. It did include a picture of a man shooting a
gun noting that as the bullet moved forward the man felt a force pushing
him backward. The example squared with his experience and he could
translate this experience to the notion of the ship moving forward when the
gasses moved backward, but it did not explain why this happened. 

He was frustrated and embarrassed. These thoughts consumed his mind for the
next few hours. Finaly his research took him on a different tangent. A few
hours later he made his way down to the engine room to find Lt. Wayne still
there silently watching Cole work. He asked if Cole had been able to figure
out what was wrong with the engine. Cole said no. He turned to Wayne and a
are there emergency proceedures?

Cole had become used to the Captain's almost embarrassingly sincere manner,
but was he really admitting that he had launched himself into deep space
over half a dozen times without ever once wondering how his ship got him
there and back? And more importantly, why was he even focused on this
problem which had no baring on the more important problem of getting
themselves back to Earth.

"Why does the action of one object cause the reaction of another?" asked
the Captain. "Because it is a law of physics" replied Cole without looking
up from her work and in a tone that barely disguised her annoyance.  "But
that does not answer the question." said the Captain with no more emotion
than if this were simply a matter of fact. He then added, "A law itself is
not a reason." For a moment no one spoke.  Wayne said to the Captain,
"Well, I never really thought about it that much. I guess you have a
point." They both looked at Cole who just shrugged her shoulders and said,
"How am I supposed to know."

At that moment, the whole ship groaned and then became quiet. "What was
that noise?" asked the Captain? "Or more importantly lack of noise" said
Cole. "That was our entire propulsion system shutting down." she added,
turning her attention to the now silent engines. "What happened?" asked
Mackenzie betraying a note of concern in his voice. Looking at Cole. "I
have no idea. it was not something I did." Cole ignored him and immediately
staring quietly. ( went to work trying to revive the engine.) Wayne just
responded, "Maybe think we lost faith." "What?" replied the captain. "It
seems that we doubted Newton's law right out of existence." replied Wayne.
This was certainly no time for humor thought the Captain. 

"That's nonsense" said the captain in a puzzled tone. "Maybe" replied
Wayne, "But for the moment it is the best answer I've got." Everyone
floated in silence.

"What now?" Both Wayne and Cole looked to the Captain. There were detailed
emergency procedures for just about every possible situation.  So many that
an entire course at flight school was devoted to them. But for more serious
situations, like the one they now faced, the procedures often seemed
futile, almost silly, like recommending that passengers on a fully disabled
atmospheric flight rest their heads between their knees before their plane
plummets into the earth. It was the nature of Flight Command, and maybe
anyone in a position of authority, to have an solution for ever problem.

But the solution to present problem they faced rested entirely in the hands
of Cole. The captain asked Cole what she needed. She said she could use
Wayne's help and would contact him if she needed further assistance. Cole
immediately began giving instructions to Wayne. The Captain stood for a
moment and watched, reluctant to leave. As a Captain he could face a no
more critical situation in his command and yet all he could do was wait.
He felt helpless and had to fight a desire to take command, though
excerting his authority at a moment like this would only 

He returned to the bridge to amend the report that he had not yet sent to
control.

Cole was moving at a determined though not frantic pace. Gone was the
frustration she had exhibited earlier. She had Wayne running a series of
tests and reporting his results while she with a meter to asses all of the
electrical circuits. She now felt a deep calm. The worst case senario was
at hand.  There was nothing to lose, nothing to fear. All she could do was
work through the problem in her methodical way.

In the back of everyone's mind was the need to resolve the problem in 48
hours. This flight disable survival window. While it varried for every
mission, it was generally accepted rule of thumb that a flight could delay
its schedule no more than 48 hours. So all serious problems had to be
resolved in that time frame. 

They worked steadily and quietly. 

It was not out of the question that the problem they faced could be
resolved in that time frame as well. It had happened on other missions and
any good engineer was well aware of these senarios.

Though
in this case they amounted to fix the problem. All of the conservation went
into place.  Ration food. Shutdown all external power. 


A full shutdown in space was bad, very bad. And they weren't just in space,
but 2.9 million miles from home. At their present speed without
acceleration, their spaceship would reach Earth in about 25 years or 24
years after their oxygen was expected to run out. They would become just
another one of the ghost ships that littering space, slowly and dutifully
returning their long deceased crew back to Earth. 

There was a wrench in the works a phrase coined when the works were far
less complex than the drive system on an intrasellar mining explorer. And
while wrenches still existed they were used mostly for simply exposing the
more complex bowels of the systems that drove them around space. A far
larger item than could be caught in Almost as complex as themselves.

Her initial tack of following rough (to relay on her) clues and hunches as
to where the problem lay had not yeilded an expect short cut to the
solution. She had now decided to employ a more thoughoug and methodical
examination of the system. Her instincts had not found a solution. This
method would take a known amount of time. Essentially picking though every
part of the system and putting it in place. The offending "wrench" would
either revel itself or simply be removed by the process. In which case the
result would not be know till they completed the whole task.

As the worked reminded Wayne of watching his father work on transports back
home when he was young. His father never asked him to help and he had
little intererest anyway. Cole described her own experience working on
farming equipment as a teenager. Her father had died when she was young and
she had starting helping the family from an early age. 

After a half an hour, the Capt. came down to inform them that he had put
all recommended emergency plans into place. Oxygen levels had been reduced.
He had established a plan for rationing food. The power systems were
reduced or turned off in all non-essential areas. Recommendations were for
reduced exertion and generally remaining calm. All of this was either
obvious or absurd. The Capt. finished by saying that he had sent a distress
signal and expected to hear back from Central shortly. The implication that
this would have any impact on their mission. 

The captain paused after finishing his report. Waiting to hear if he was
needed, but after no one spoke he added, "Well I need to..."

The result of the emergency proceedures was that the ship became less
comfortable, less cool, less dry, less breathable. After the captain left,
Wayne said, "He is a bit of an odd duck." One of the cardinal rules of
long-term flights was not to disparage another crew member behind their
back, but it was rarel followed. Cole responded with only a mild "yeah".
Wayne than asked whether she had ever spent time with him outside of
flight, what she knew about his family... 

After three hours of work they stopped to wait for their last test to
complete. Each of them broke out a small portion of rations. This was
against the emegency rationing plan but they knew that staying alert and
well-fed during the process was more important. There was something that
bugged Wayne about the captain. Something that did not seem right and he
wanted Cole to share his feeling. He wanted to confirm his sense of the
world. Finally he asked, "Do you think Captain Mckenzie is an android?" 

This stopped Cole. She had not enjoyed his questions about the Captain and
she did not enjoy his. "What do you mean she asked?" as if the question
itself were absurd. 

Over the past thirty years, robots had taken on more complex and human-like
tasks, but to this point they were still mechanical and biomechanical
devices that could perform some human tasks but that could hardly be
mistaken for human.  The two fields of pure robotics building up from
scratch and bio-robotics starting with lifeforms and exerting more and more
control over their behavior. The field of computing had produced impressive
software that had long surpassed the understanding of the individuals who
iniated the software. 

The ones revealed to the public had been relatively easily distinguished
from their human counterparts, but the science was advancing rapidly and
rumors of more and more advanced versions existed.

"It is just that he has got no sense of humor." said Wayne. "And so you
immediately assume he is robot just because he does not laugh at your
jokes?"  "It's not that...he just seems odd and unemotional." "Well, he is
not an android. I have known him for years. And besides, I don't believe
the rumors about the goverment making humans better than humans." 

"Well it is crazy." she said. "I have know him for three years. He is not
an android." "Well, it just seems like a possiblity."  "So you believe the
rumors about the government making humans better than humans?" "It seems
likely." he said trying to bolster his argument by refering to scientific
journals from his own research. 

"Well he has a family. So unless they have figured out how to make robots
have kids, you may need to rethink your theory." "How do you know he has
a family?" Wayne asked. Cole just looked at Wayne feeling annoyed. Why was
he bringing this all up now, she thought. Changing the subject she said,
"We need to start checking the forward compression system." Wayne followed
Cole provided assistance.

An hour later, Capt. Mackenzie came into the engine room. Twelve hours has
passed since complete engine shut down. The warning lights continued to
flash. The fourty eight hour clock showed 36 hours left. So far they had
all remained calm. Mackenzie asked if there was any news? Cole looked over
and was tempted to say, "Only that Wayne here thinks you are a robot." But
instead said, "We have completed base tests and have found no fault. We are
now just finishing our tests on the forward compression." She gave no sign
of hope because there was no sign to give. But she remained confident that
a solution would be found and in time. The captain looked over at Wayne who
returned his glance without saying anything. The captain then asked Wayne
if he had any thoughts about the matter. Wayne said that he did not.

The capt. said he could be reached if they needed him. 

Suddenly Cole stopped. "Test that again." she said. "What do you mean?"
"Hold the probe next to the heat section." "This is failing." "What does
htta mean." :w













Back on the bridge, Captain Mackenzie composed a message describing their
situation and sent it off to mission control. Looking out, he could imagine
the message making its way safely back to Earth in a matter of minutes. He
wondered how their situation would fair under the scrutiny of Space
Control's cost benefit analysts. Would they advise mission control to cut
their losses? What could mission control do anyway?

Twenty two hours later, the engine room looked more like a repair shop with
engine parts everywhere. Under the premise of desparation, Cole had
dismanteled most of the engine and was methodically testing each individual
section before moving on to the next.  Wayne and Cole spoke very little.
Instead Cole addressed the engine directly, quietly continuing her
one-sided debate. Her only conversation with Wayne involved instructing him
to move an engine part or help with anything that required two hands.




While moving a large cooling pipe, Wayne without realizing it, hit Cole in the
head.  Cole who was standing closely behind him turned and pushed Wayne sharply
from behind, saying "Watch where you're going." "Hey, why did you hit me?" said
Wayne. "You hit me first." muttered Cole who had turned back to her task. Then
cracking a smile for the first time in more than a day, she said, "For every
action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." Wayne stood their rubbing his
shoulder and said, "Yes, but you hit me harder." Cole now turning to face Wayne
said, "Not possible, that would violate the laws of physics." "Assuming they
still apply." responded Wayne. 

Both Cole and Wayne sat down after working for past eighteen hours straight. Wayne
opened a package of the calorie bars that they had already begun to ration.  Cole
asked, "Do you really think we've passed into some mysterious realm beyond the reach
of Newton?" Wayne, just gave a short laugh. 

"Every action" Cole mused. "Does that mean that mean that every time I scratch my
butt, there is someone else un-scratching their butt?" "You scratch your butt?" asked
Wayne. "Well, only when I can't find someone to scratch it for me." said Cole. Wayne
smiled and said "Well, I guess Newton's law does not apply to butt scratching." "Or
probably, other bodily functions." responded Cole. 

"Well that seems to debunk the 'every action' portion of the law" said Wayne.  "For
some actions there is an equal and opposite reaction" does not sound like much of a
law said Cole. Both Wayne and Cole looked up as they noticed Captain Mackenzie, who
had been quietly standing at the door. "What bothers me is this notion that the
action and reaction are two distinct events" he added. "Does the gas leaving the ship
cause the ship to go forward or does the ship going forward cause the gas to leave
the ship?" "Sometimes there are actions and they are equal and opposite." said Cole.

"Well it seems that we are now even farther from solving the problem." said
Mackenzie. "What problem are you referring to, sir?" asked Cole. Mackenzie flustered
said, "Well, I think a better understanding of propulsion can only be to our
advantage." :wq
:wq

The captain checked his watch and contemplated how long it would keep working long
after lifesuport and run out.
