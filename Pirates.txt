As we sat in the shade of the willow tree, Dad pointed out the
different types of boats on the river. None of the boats were very
big. They were mostly sail boats and mostly used as trainers by the
local colleges, but Dad described each one seriously. He told us which
ones were fast and why, which ones could carry the most cargo and how
many crew they each needed.

As he spoke, we paid close attention. Dad was still Dad, even for Michael
my older brother who was almost 15. Dad's arms seemed as strong as steel
and six foot frame seemed as tall as tall could be.

As he gathered us into a circle to describe his plan, I could sense
that something dangerous was about to happen and that there was no way
I could avoid it. Michael and Wendy never seemed scared. It was as if
they and Dad were made of the same material, but I was different. I
sometimes felt like I wasn't supposed to be there, but there was no
where else to go. 

The plan was to capture one of the sail boats, in particular one of
the 21-foot Sonars which Dad described as the most worthy boat on the
river. The only question was how to launch our attack. 

Not far to our left was a sandy spot where a few people were putting their
kayaks into the river. Dad decided that we should wait until one of the
two-person kayaks was left temporarily unattended and then quickly and
quietly commandeer it for our own.

When the moment came, Dad signaled to us move. By the time we reached the
sand we were running full speed. As arranged, I jumped on front and lay
low.  Michael took the front seat and Dad took the back. Wendy pushed hard
from the shore and leap onto the rear of the boat and then lay low as well.
We were quickly underway with Dad and Michael paddling hard. 
   
The other people on the launch area seemed startled by our actions, but
made no attempt to stop us. By the time the couple noticed we had taken
their kayak, we were far out on the river. I could hear their shouts and
glanced back to see them waving their arms in a way that seemed indicate
they felt there must be some misunderstanding.

I could also see the intent faces of Wendy, Michael and Dad who were
looking past me and focused on a single sail boat that Dad had pointed out
as our target. The boat was coming toward us and moving fast in the strong
wind. It was on a slight tack cutting from right to left across our bow.
The two college students piloting the boat tried to make adjustments to
their course in order to avoid us, but we countered each of their moves.

As the students began to notice that something was seriously wrong,
they started to wave us off in an attempt to avoid a collision, but
Micheal and Dad just dug in harder making their intention clear to
even the most naive observer.

By this point, Wendy had moved forward of Dad and we were all three
standing. Wendy and Micheal both barefoot with pants rolled up past their
ankles. Wendy with dark streaks of mud or grease smeared on her face and
Michael with his T-shirt tied roughly about his head.  

A moment before collision, we jumped to their boat with feral screams. The
students dropped their lines and rudder, and stood with hands slightly
raised, staring as Wendy and Michael rushed toward them. One of them began
to form a question, but their soft cafeteria fed bodies were no match for
our sharp hungry frames wielding paddles and savagery.  Wendy and Michael
slowly marched them backwards right off the boat and into the water. They
bobbed in their life jackets and in the wake of the commotion and tried to
make their way clear of the boat.

Dad grabbed the rudder and shouted commands. Wendy held the main sheet and
I the jib.  Instinctively we pulled the sails taught as if we had done this
all our lives. The boat swung round quickly facing back out toward the
river and the other boats, and was again underway in a strong wind.
Micheal stood on the bow and with some paper he had found and rolled into
spyglass and he pointed to our next target -- a boat of similar size that
we were no doubt intended to seize and loot. 

But a few moments later, he saw and pointed out a motorized launch leaving
the harbor headed our way. It seemed that word of our adventure had reached
the dock.  Dad immediately changed course and we headed for a stone wall
that bordered the river near a road bridge.  Although the motor boat was
moving fast, we were not far from the stone wall and a metal ladder that
was set into the stone wall leading up to the roadway above. As we
approached, we dropped the sails and Dad guided the boat quickly against
the ladder.

Dad held the ladder while we each scampered up. We left the boat rocking
aimlessly, its sails helplessly flapping the water. When we all reached the
top, Wendy and Michael quickly redressed themselves and we made our way
onto the sidewalk and down into the city streets with only a little
dampness on our clothing to betray our exploit. As we began to feel safe
from pursuit, we slowed our hurried pace and at first Wendy and then
Michael began to laugh, a deep and pure laugh and I laughed too. Dad smiled
but in a way that merely meant, "Job well done."  He kept us moving along
and as the day slowly turned to dusk we made our way home.

I don't remember mom, at least, that is what Michael and Wendy tell me.
They I say I was too young to remember, but I remember a woman. I remember
her face and her smile. I remember her looking down at me and I remember
feeling helpless and safe though sometimes the perspective changes and in
my memory I am looking at both my mother and me. I don't tell Michael and
Wendy. This is my memory and it is something they can't take.

The story goes that mom left us when we were young and then died. No one
was ever willing to say much more about her than this. Michael and Wendy
would sometimes talk about our old house and their memories of playing
store in the playhouse that dad built in the back yard. There was the time
the curtains caught fire when dad was trying to fix a radiator, and how I
used to stand in front of the television set when they were trying to
watch. These are their memories, but they have become mine as well. 

After mom died we moved to the city and lived in an apartment. The
apartment was where my real memories began. Michael and I shared a room and
Wendy had her own room. We lived on the 34th floor and could look out over
the city. Even though our building was much taller, we could not imagine a
better view than the one we had. Between two buildings we could even see
the water. We would spend hours looking out the window at the city and
making up stories about everything we saw. 

This was also a time when we still went to school. I liked school. Michael
and Wendy say they didn't but that is not how I remember it. One day in
school we were given an assignment to create a family tree. Our teacher,
Mr. Cormio described how we could use lines, photos and names to create an
image that showed our place in the world. He talked about the importance of
relatives and how we all came from different places. I raised my had:w:w

I particularly
liked my last teacher, Mr. Cormio. I would often stay late 

We lived in neighborhood that had and changed hands a few times. The
present residents were mostly Puerto Rica. Dad said we were American's and
specically Yankees. We were ex-pats living in a foreign land. Dad spoke
Spanish with the natives as he called. Just because they had not lived
there forever did nto make them natives. This was their home and we were
ex-pats.  Or ex patriots as he described.  Enough Spanish to get by. He
said this was the problem with Americans. There were good patriots but
terrible ex-patriots. We were not Italian or Irish. We were American. It
was our country because we had won it fair and square in battle against the
British the Indians and the French, Spanish. And these were the battles we
had lost precisely because there were no battles. Unlike all other
imigrants who just came in and squated untill they felt at home. But we had
lost it to squatters. Without even realizing it because there was no
battle.   But now we were ex-pats and we needed to understand our role.  It
was the kind of logic that worked for Dad. 	

He grew plants on the roof. His garden was organized. But the natives would
take things. He wanted to teach them new ways to live. He wanted to make
them into Yankees. He hated their televisions. :w

Finally laughing. Dad more serious. Dad felt job well done. as if we
had accomplished a task or mission.


We stood watching a girls soccer game. We had been on our way to the
store and I am not sure why we stopped.  It was just one of those
moments were we all seemed to have the same thought at once. The girls
on our side of the field were from the local high school. We didn't
say anything. Dad seemed to be studing the game very carefully. The
local team appeared to be losing. 

Dad then turned to us and said, the problem is that they are not using
their hands. You see, each team is trying to move the ball into the
other team's goals, but if they just used their hands it would be so
much easier. Suddenly the game appeared as silly as a sack race with
girls awkwardly trying to 

Just as the ball came close to where we were standing, Dad ran onto
the field grabbed the ball with his hands and then started running
toward the opposing team's goal. Both referres were blowing their
whistles and moving toward him. The girls just stopped playing and
stood staring at Dad as he ran past them making his way to the goal.
As he flung the ball in the goal, Michael and Wendy let out huge
cheers and I joined in with them.  


Every little trival thought that enters one's head is
immediately sent out into the universe, ideas barely
formed. The cost of transmission too easy. The barrier
too low. No need or time to sit with a thought and work
it out. No time to think at all. The cost of
transmission so small that the merest thought could be
flung into the universe. Television as insidious as it
was, was at least created with some effort. Some work
went into creating the scripts. Some thought went into
working with the actors, albeit for the masses. But we
had traded one medium curated for the masses with
another currated by the masses with no great
improvement. No need for sustained thought. No time for
ideas to be born and die before reaching maturity. No
time for maturity at all. Sustained thinking was no
longer necessary or even possible. 

When he came into the bodega he saw a television set
which was not there when he last visited.  It was for
his customers the owner said. He himself rarely
watched, but he could not take his eyes off the screen.

Why did anyone who aspired to any sort of intellectual
status feel guilty about this box. They would deny
watching it as if they honestly believed this. The
whole country had moved into a sense of denial as if it
were an epidemic. But had it always been this way? Did
people always feel a conflict between their actual
lives and their perceived lives. Was modern life just
filled with more guilty pleasures. 

No sooner does the screen pop into her hand than some
nacent idea journey forth, still wet from birth, with a
no more instinct than that necessary for blinking and
breathing, comes forth screaming and shouting and
dying. 

Even the dog ignores the television. The dogs life
seems changed little since his domestication. In the
modern world his freedom is more restricted but his
interaction with the world remains the same.  He
sleeps. He eats. He sleeps without regard for modern
light. Still finding his rythm of the sun. Television
sets have not effect on the dog. He rides in cars, but
without intention or car. It is not a great machine of
conveyance, but simply a place to be like any other. He
is equally oblivious to his own mortality yet still
shares our instinct for survival.
