As we sat in the shade of the willow tree, Dad pointed out the different
types of boats on the river. None of the boats were very big. They were
mostly sail boats and mostly used as trainers by the local colleges, but
Dad described each one as seriously as if it where a xx schooner. He told us
which ones were fast and why, which ones could carry the most cargo and how
many crew they each needed.

As he spoke, we paid close attention. Dad was still Dad, even for Michael
my older brother who was almost 15. Dad's tautly muscled arms seemed as
strong as steel and six foot frame seemed as tall as tall could be.

As he gathered us into a circle to describe his plan, I could sense
that something dangerous was about to happen and that there was no way
I could avoid it. Michael and Wendy never seemed scared. It was as if
they and Dad were made of the same material, but I was different. I
sometimes felt like I wasn't supposed to be there, but there was no
where else to go. 

The plan was to capture one of the sail boats, in particular one of
the 21-foot Sonars which Dad described as the most worthy boat on the
river. The only question was how to launch our attack. 

Not far to our left was a sandy spot where a few people were putting their
kayaks into the river. Dad decided that we should wait until one of the
two-person kayaks was left temporarily unattended and then quickly and
quietly commandeer it for our own.

When the moment came, Dad signaled to us move. By the time we reached the
sand we were running full speed. As arranged, I jumped on front and lay
low.  Michael took the front seat and Dad took the back. Wendy pushed hard
from the shore and leapt onto the rear of the boat and then lay low as well.
We were quickly underway with Dad and Michael paddling hard. 
   
The other people on the launch area seemed startled by our actions, but
made no attempt to stop us. By the time the couple noticed we had taken
their kayak, we were far out on the river. I could hear their shouts and
glanced back to see them waving their arms in a way that seemed indicate
they felt there must be some misunderstanding.

I could also see the intent faces of Wendy, Michael and Dad who were
looking past me and focused on a single sail boat that Dad had pointed out
as our target. The boat was coming toward us and moving fast in the strong
wind. It was on a slight tack cutting from right to left across our bow.
The two college students piloting the boat tried to make adjustments to
their course in order to avoid us, but we countered each of their moves.

As the students began to notice the seriousness of the situation, they
started to wave us off in an attempt to avoid a collision, but Micheal and
Dad just dug in harder making their intention clear to even the most naive
observer.

By this point, Wendy had moved forward of Dad and we were all three
standing. Wendy and Micheal both barefoot with pants rolled up past their
ankles. Wendy with dark streaks of mud smeared on her face and Michael with
his T-shirt tied roughly about his head.  

A moment before collision, we jumped to their boat with feral screams and
teeth bared. The students dropped their lines and rudder and stood staring
as Wendy and Michael rushed toward them. They both put out their hands in a
half-hearted attempt to defend themselves, but their soft cafeteria-fed
bodies were no match for our sharp hungry frames wielding paddles and
savagery. Wendy and Michael slowly marched them backwards right off the
boat and into the water. They bobbed in their life jackets and in the wake
of the commotion and tried to make their way clear of the boat.

Dad grabbed the rudder and shouted commands. Wendy held the main sheet and
I the jib.  Instinctively we pulled the sails taught as if we had done this
all our lives. The boat swung round quickly facing back out toward the
river and the other boats, and was again underway in a strong wind.
Micheal stood on the bow and with some paper he had found and rolled into
spyglass and he pointed to our next target -- a boat of similar size that
we were no doubt intended to seize and loot. 

But a few moments later, he saw and pointed out a motorized launch leaving
the harbor headed our way. It seemed that word of our adventure had reached
the dock.  Dad immediately changed course and we headed for a stone wall
that bordered the river near a road bridge.  Although the motor boat was
moving fast, we were not far from the stone wall and a metal ladder that
was set into the stone wall leading up to the roadway above. As we
approached, we dropped the sails and Dad guided the boat quickly against
the ladder.

Dad held the ladder while we each scampered up. We left the boat rocking
aimlessly, its sails helplessly flapping the water. When we all reached the
top, Wendy and Michael quickly redressed themselves and we made our way
onto the sidewalk and down into the city streets with only a little
dampness on our clothing to betray our exploit. As we began to feel safe
from pursuit, we slowed our hurried pace and at first Wendy and then
Michael began to laugh, a deep and uncontrollable laugh. I laughed too.
Dad smiled but in a way that merely meant, "Job well done."  He kept us
moving along and as the day slowly turned to dusk we made our way home.

I don't remember mom, at least, that is what Michael and Wendy tell me.
They I say I was too young to remember, but I remember sitting at a table
in a kitchen and I remember the sun coming through curtains that seemed so
thin as to barely keep out the light. I remember a woman standing and I
remember a dark hair and dark eyes and her pale skin. I remember her
looking down at me and I remember her smile. I have never shared this
memory with Michael and Wendy. It is mine and they cannot take it.

The story goes that mom died when were young. After mom died, Dad moved us
to the city and we lived in an apartment which is where my real memories
began. Michael and I shared a room and Wendy had her own room. We lived on
the 34th floor and could look out over the city. Even though our building
was much taller, we could not imagine a better view than the one we had.
Between two buildings we could even see the water and boats passing out to
sea. We would spend hours looking out the window at the city and making up
stories about all the people who lived in the buildings around us.

This was also a time when we still went to school. I liked school. Michael
and Wendy say they didn't, but that is not how I remember it. I remember
staying after school in Mr. Klein's room. Mr. Klein taught social studies.
He had white hair and wore checked shirts. He had a box filled with colored
pencils and after school he let me use them to draw.  Sometimes we talked,
but mostly I just drew.

Then we stopped going to school and shortly after that we moved. Michael
told us that Dad quit his job so we could no longer live in the apartment
building. I was sad to leave. All my memories of the apartment are happy
ones, real or imagined, I am not sure it makes a difference.

We moved to a neighborhood south of the center of the city where the
buildings were not as tall, so that you could see more of the sky. The
streets were still filled with people and vehicles, but here they seemed to
move to at a different sort of rhythm, one that appeared less predictable,
consistent and familiar.

Our apartment was just above a small store or bodega as it was called in
Spanish. Dad told us that the neighborhood had changed hands a few times
over the past half century. The present residents were mostly Puerto Rican.
Dad said we were Yankees which was a kind of American and as much as Dad
ever said about where we were from.

Dad spoke Spanish with the natives as he called them. We were living in
their land, part of a patchwork that was now America, won over in battles
so subtle that no one knew they were being fought. He said it was better to
know the enemy than to fear them.

That evening after we returned home Dad went down to the bodega. He often
spent time there talking to Mr. Santana who owned the store and our
apartment.  The store was small and sold a variety of packaged food and
assorted other items such as balls of string, balloons and bags of toy
soldiers. A few weeks earlier, Mr. Santana had put a small television in
his store. Dad was continually trying to convince him to get rid of it.
Mr. Santana told Dad that he just put it in for his customers. He said they
liked to watch the football matches. But every time we visited the store
Mr. Santana always seemed to be looking at the screen.

Dad hated television or the idiot box as he referred to it. Sometimes if we
were walking in the evening and saw a television through a window on in a
house he would stop us and point out how dead the people looked staring at
the blue screen. We would stand there watching them watch TV and he would
say "They might as well be dead and they don't even know it."

Dad also disliked any contraption, as he called them, that made people lazy
or stupid and this included everything from air conditioners to ice makers.
But it was these very items that Dad was often employed to fix by Mr.
Santana, who would come to our door ask for Dad when just about anything in
his store or building broke. Dad would grumble that if it weren't for him
nothing in this place would work and that might just be good thing. But he
always went along with Mr. Santana and always came back saying, wondering
how people can live in world they can't fix.

Soon after we arrived, Dad got a job at a small factory that manufactured
lace. The kind of lace that was found on curtains and women's clothing. Not
that we knew much about lace or women's clothing but that was what was on
display At least that is
what we saw in the ancient samples display at the factory. It was housed on
one floor of a large two-story brick building and had been in business for
over 70 years. It was owned by two old men who were brothers and who had
inherited the business from their father and had remained throughout the
neighborhood's cultural transitions. 

Dad got the job one afternoon when we were exploring our new neighborhood.
One of the old men who owned the factory was showing us around the floor
which seemed to house more machines than people when we found ourselves
standing next to an older woman who was bent over trying to remove a tangle
of thread from a machine that was not working. The thread had gotten
wrapped around a part of the machine where it was not supposed to be
wrapped. The old man complained that they used to have a repair person on
staff, but now it would take weeks to find someone who could come to the
factory and repair it.  

Without asking, Dad began helping the woman remove the stuck thread and
then began to inspect the machine. He told the man he would repair the
machine for him and then told us to run along and he would met us back at
home later. The old man looked at Dad, not sure what to make of him, but
seemed tired of trying to make sense of things and just smiled and nodded
and then walked us to the door and said good bye.

It took Dad the whole afternoon to get the machine back up and running. He
had to manufacture a replacement part in the factory's machine shop which
Dad said, looked like it had not been used in 20 years. 

Whenever we dropped by the factory, we would as often find Dad on the
factory floor as in the office with the two old brothers, trying to
convince them to make this or that improvement, but the old men had been
doing things the same way for too long to make this or that improvement.
They always listened to his pitch, but in the end usually decided in favor
of keeping things the way they were.

One morning when we arrived we found Dad standing quietly on the factory
floor. When he saw us he raised his hand for us to stop and said, "Quiet.
Listen. What do you hear?" Not knowing what we were listening for, but
wanting to provide an answer Micheal said, "Weaving machines?" "A machine
is not working properly. Can you tell which one?" He asked. "You need to
listen carefully."  

To me the factory always sounded like a thousand typewriters all
perpetually typing a thousand different manuscripts. But Dad heard
something different. He said, "Machines are designed by man and man can't
design something except by intention. Just as you can look at any object in
nature and know that it is damaged, even one you have never seen before.
God, like man, does not intentionally design imperfection. And imperfection
has a sound and a feel that rings as clear a church bell."

"Listen." he said again and walked us to one of the lace making machines
and pointed out a small rod that had come lose on one end and was now
lazily and repetitively knocking into a nearby strut every time the spindle
to which it was still attached made a rotation.

With Dad at the factory, we spent most days out on our own. Michael usually
set the agenda. For weeks we mapped the city's sewer system. We tried to
reach the roofs of the tallest buildings in the city. We built a tree fort
in a local park. Rainy days, we often spent in the library once playing hid
and seek until we were asked to leave. The real adventures happened with
Dad, which was for me, thankfully becoming less frequent.

Our days were punctuated by breakfast and dinner, which we had at the same
time each day with Dad. We were responsible for gathering and preparing
food. Dad provided Michael with money each week, which was never quite
enough to cover what we needed. It was understood that we needed to obtain
food however we could, but we could not steal. 

The first spring after we arrived, Dad began building a garden on our roof.
The garden did not look like any garden we had seen before. He said it was
special because it did not require soil and could grow plants faster and
larger than other gardens. The garden was made from long pieces of gutter
and pipe that he found or retrieved from the factory. The gutter and pipe
was used to hold the plants which initially consisted of herbs and tomatoes
in long rows. Together they formed a continuous track that wound around the
entire roof making its way from where it began about eight feet up fixed to
the side of a brick chimney down to a water tank resting on the roof. The
water flowed continuously down until it reached the tank where it was
pumped back up to the top of the garden pipe system. In the tank of water
were small fish which Dad said provided the nutrients that the plants
needed to grow.

In order to get water on our roof, Dad had tapped a spigot into a water
pipe on the neighbor's roof and used a hose to reach our roof. When the
woman who owned the house next door saw what Dad had done she yelled at him
saying that he was stealing her water. Dad said that it was not much water
and that this he was creating this garden for the whole community. She said
he was crazy and should stop messing around on the roofs of buildings. She
never accepted his offerings of vegetables, but never shut off the water
either. (Whenever she saw dad she would yell at him but that was it)

Over time, the garden began producing tomatoes and peppers and squash and
garlic and lettuce and basil. It was sometimes more vegetables than we
could eat and Dad sometimes shared the extra produce with neighbors, though
in exchange they had to listen to him pitch his vision of soil-less gardens
on all the roofs of the neighborhood. He would say, "We can feed the whole
neighborhood with real food and not be dependent on whatever comes in those
metal cans and plastic bags that Mr. Santana passes off as food in his bodega." 

When he told this to Mr. Santana, he just laughed and said, "Do you eat
only what you grow on the roof?" Dad said, "No" but he said he had proved
it was possible. Mr. Santana laughed, "then come back and talk to me when
you can grow a bag of potato chips. Because that is what people want to
eat." 

Dad was often dragging neighbors up to the roof to show them the garden.
They would ask, "Why would I want to put a garden on my roof when I can buy
what I need from the store?" But there was one old man who lived alone in
an apartment on the first floor and who spoke no English seemed to
appreciate Dad's work and would often visit and help take care of the
plants. In exchange, Dad let him take what he wanted.

Dad's vision for the neighborhood went beyond just roof top gardens. At
night he worked on detailed plans for the neighborhood that including
systems for water collection so "we would not need to depend on city water
with all its toxic chemicals", orchards in the middle of the street growing
up through the asphalt and furnaces for using waste to generate heat. He
drew his plan on a large role of paper would gather us around the table and
walk us through his detailed maps some made up of multiple letter sized
sheets of paper taped together. 

Once after dinner, he brought up Mr. Santana to show him the plans. After
listening to Dad, he said it sounded like what the communist rebels told
the people in his village, before they started kidnapping the boys them and
stealing their food.

Late one summer evening while we were finishing the dishes, we heard Dad
and another voice shouting on the roof. We went up and found Dad arguing in
English with the neighbor's son. The boy looked about 20 years old and was
holding a bag of vegetables that he had collected from Dad's garden. Dad
called him a thief and demanded that he return the produce. The boy said
that Dad was crazy and a thief since he was stealing his their water to
raise his plants.

For a moment they just stood just inches apart, the boy a inch or so
shorter than Dad. I could see the boy's clenched fist, the muscles in his
jaw flexing as they looked straight at each other.  

Then Dad reached for the bag, but the boy pulled it out of his reach and
pushed Dad away with his other hand. Dad grabbed the boy's hand. The boy
dropped the bag and swung a punch at Dad's chest. Dad lunged forward and
punched the boy across the face. The boy fell back landing against roof
vent and rolled on his side. He slowly got up and wiped blood from his
nose. He shouted something at Dad in Spanish that we did not understand and
walked back to the stair entrance on his side of the roof. Dad watched him
but did not respond. Dad picked up the bag of produce and we all went down
stairs.

That evening before going to bed no one spoke much. Sometime after midnight
I woke to the sound of metal being smashed against metal and the whoops and
cries of multiple voices. The sound was coming from the roof. Michael was
already awake. I looked over at him as he lay awake in his bed. The light
from the street outlining his profile. He did not return my look and said
nothing. The next morning the three of us went up on the roof and found
Dad's garden completely smashed. The pipes were all broken. The vegetables
and plants were crushed. The tank upside down and the fish dead on the
roof. We never saw Dad go back on the roof after that evening and he never
spoke about the incident.

A night later a rock was thrown through our window while we were eating
dinner. Michael and Wendy ran to the window, but could not see anyone. We
all looked back at Dad who was still sitting at the table. He looked at
Michael and said, "Make sure to clean up all the glass and place a piece of
cardboard over the broken section of window." He then got up to get his
coat and left. 

We did not see him again until the next morning at breakfast when he told
us that we should pack up our clothes and be ready to leave the apartment
by the time he returned that evening.

That day we quietly packed up everything we could carry with us. Wendy and
Michael had backpacks and I had a duffel bag to which I had sewed shoulder
straps. That evening we left the apartment without even saying good bye to
Mr. Santana. Dad said he would come back to get anything we needed and
could not carry with us.

We boarded a bus at the end of our street traveling neither toward nor away
from the city center which stood always in the background with its polished
towers standing tall at the center of a chaotic urban surrounding. The bus
felt bright inside. The passengers included a few sleepy men and women
coming home from the sort of work that was not contained between the hours
of 9 and 5. At the back of the bus sat a tight group of restless teenagers
that all seemed a little older than Michael and Wendy. They laughed as a
girl sitting on a boys lap was unable to keep her balance whenever the bus
accelerated or changed direction.

Soon we were on busy street full of people and lights and noise. The kids
tumbled off laughing and teasing each other and quickly became part of the
crowd mingling and moving along sidewalk. The bus continued on leaving the
bright lights behind. A few minutes later we were travelling down a wide
street in a quiet neighborhood. Nearing an intersection with no apparent
distinguishing features, Dad indicated that the next stop was ours. 

As the bus drove away, we found ourselves standing on a dark and unfamiliar
sidewalk carrying everything we owned on our back while Dad took his
bearings. A few houses had lights on inside. Many did not. Some had their
windows covered with plywood and looked liked they had not been lived in
for years. The street light across the street flickered and then went out
joining most of the other street lights on the street.

As we walked, we passed a few people sitting on their stoops or around a
car in the warm summer night. The people we passed mostly ignored us. A few
cars drove by. Some came by slowly, their windows down and playing loud
music. Sometimes we heard someone call out and could not tell if they were
addressing us. Either way, we made no attempt to respond and kept moving
forward.

We walked for about 10 blocks until we came to a large and clearly
abandoned house which was surrounded by a tall iron fence. From the front
gate, an overgrown brick walk led to a set of wooden steps and then a large
double door. The house did not seem happy to see us. It had a weary
expression that said I have lived alone for a long time and I am too tired
for this.

Inside the front door was a foyer with large rooms to the right and left.
Directly ahead was a set of stairs leading to the upper floors. All of the
windows on the first floor had been boarded up. From a window on the second
floor landing, a beam of moonlight shown down to where we were standing and
in it floated a storm of dust particles animated after years of slumber by
our sudden entry.

We quickly surveyed the first floor, like a dog that instinctively circles
before settling down to a safe resting place. Dad then led us up the stairs
and into the first room we found. There was no furniture in the room, but
it felt like it had probably been a bedroom. One window provided dim light
from the street. We put down our packs and Dad placed a large handkerchief
on the floor. He brought some bread and cheese and water from his bag and
we sat and ate quietly. As we ate, Dad looked around as if he were seeing
things that we could not see. We just followed his gaze and tried to
imagine what he was thinking.

After we finished, Dad said, "Okay, time to get some rest." We
instinctively looked for where we were supposed to sleep but the room was a
box without feature, so we lay close to together and tried to find comfort
on the hardwood floor resting our heads on a shirt or sweater retrieved
from our packs. I was the last to fall asleep that night. I lay awake too
anxious to close my eyes thinking over the journey that led us here and the
journey that lay ahead until finally sleep overcame me. 

The next morning, we all rose early as through the window that provided dim
light from the street last night, now came streaming the unshaded morning
sun. As we woke Dad was standing by the window looking out. He turned to us
and said, "Who needs to pee?" smiling as he knew his question would have
its intended effect. "The bathroom is down the hall." he said, but before
we were on our feet, he added, "But the toilet is out of order. This house
has no running water." "It has no gas or electricity for that matter." He
went on. "It is completely disconnected from the so called civilized
world." As he spoke, we all hoped this would not be one of his long
lectures. "So for the moment, I placed two buckets in the bathroom. One is
empty and one contains dirt. Place some dirt in the empty bucket and then
use it to relieve yourself then add some more dirt.  Once you are done,
take both bucket into the backyard and bury the contents of one and add
more dirt to the other."

Returning with both buckets, we saw Dad leaning on the back porch railing
with both hands and smiling. He said. "She's a beaut ain't she?" We stopped
and stood looking up at Dad. Even Michael and Wendy seemed a bit
overwhelmed by all that had happened in the past few days. Shading his eyes
from the low morning sun, Michael asked, "Whose house is this?" "Why this
is our house." said Dad with all the confidence of a used car salesman. "It
was left here, abandoned by its former occupants. Unable to care for it, I
suppose. Needs a little work" He said as he turned to flick a lose paint
chip off the clapboard siding "but sound as can be" he patted the same
piece of clapboard. "Why this house has been standing here since before the
turn of the century" he looked up at the house. As we tried to make sense
of everything he was saying, Wendy asked "Do you think they will want it
back?" "Who will want it back?" Dad asked vaguely still looking up at the
house and as if he sincerely did not understand the question. Wendy added,
"The people who left it." Dad quickly turned round and growled "Just let
'em try!" He then laughed out loud and Wendy and Michael laughed with him
and then Michael raised his fist and shouted "Hurrah!" joined by Dad and
Wendy in turn.

Dad then took us on a tour of the large yard pointing out the future
location of a vegetable garden, fruit trees, water tanks, a green house and
a windmill. Dad spoke with no hesitation. Each of the features he described
felt more real to him than the uneven earth, clumps of weeds and trash and
scrap that presently made up the yard.

After touring the yard, we went back inside and sat around a large table
that seemed like it had been there since the house, one of the few
remaining pieces of furniture, in what had been the dinning room and ate
the remaining bread and cheese from last night. Dad inventoried the state
of the house. In addition to no running water, gas and electricity, he
listed a leaking roof, broken windows, a lack of basic furniture, curtains
and tools. 

It took us three days to establish a working zone of water on the first
floor of the house which included one bathroom and the kitchen. The process
began with shutting off all the water valves we could find and turning them
on one by one starting with the main valve in the street until we found
leaks. Dad would fix the leaks with tools he brought home from the factory
and we would move on to the next leak or broken pipe.

After three days of using the buckets, we were all relieved to have a
working toilet, but Dad made clear that water was to be treated precious
resource. He said our connection to the city supply was only temporary
until we could establish a source of our own.  

Over the remainder of the week, we reconnected the gas stove and brought
power to the refrigerator. We were unable to get the hot water tank working
which Dad said was a blessing in disguise. It meant that we would need to
continue taking cold showers and that we would not have gas heat.

Even in the warm weather, the cold showers felt too cold. I could not
imagine even taking a shower as the days got colder. Dad said he would work
out a plan for heating the house in the winter.

Over the next few months, we repaired the roof, fixed windows, found
furniture, stock piled wood and cleared the yard. Dad spent most days at
the factory, but he always left clear instructions about exactly what
needed to be accomplished and made sure we had whatever tools we needed.

One of our tasks was scavenging, which over time I grew to enjoy. Dad kept
a running list of items that we needed for the house including tools,
mechanical fittings and furniture. About once a week, we would head out at
night to search abandoned houses or look through what people left out on
the curb. We rarely went on adventures.

Our house was one of three on a small and irregularly formed block which
was defined by two streets. One street went straight along one side of our
house and the other made a rough arc meeting the first street at both ends
and forming the shape of a capital D. Each of the three houses faced out in
different directions like the battlements of a medieval fort.

Our block was an anomaly among the rows of straight streets evenly lined
with houses that made up much of the neighborhood. Dad said the houses on
our block were built when man was free.  before the days when men cared
about patterns, when men were placed in neat little boxes all lined up in a
row.  right angles

The house directly behind ours was a small and brightly painted cottage
that made the drab houses around it look even more drab. In it lived an old
man and even though it was much smaller than our house it seemed quite
large for one person. When we first arrived, we would see the old man
outside each morning moving slowly and purposefully as he tended his
garden. 

The third house on our block which sat next to the old man's cottage looked
abandoned, if it weren't for the two boys and their mother that lived
there. The screen door at the back of the house hung loosely from the door
frame and slapped against the house in the wind.  A window on the second
floor was broken and remained broken. One of the gutters hung across the
house from roof to the ground. In the yard there were old chairs, what
looked like a washing machine and the husk of a rusting car.

At night, we could see into both houses from Wendy's room. With no electric
lights, our days ended with the descending of the sun. Often, we would be
cleaning up from dinner just as the last remaining rays of sun light made
their way over the horizon and night set in. Before going to bed, we lit
candles so that we could see more easily when we brushed our teeth and made
our way upstairs but we usually blew them out when got to our room. We told
each other that we should not waste them, but mostly we were just tired
after a long day and like the excuse.

We would sit together at the window looking into the artificially lit rooms
in the houses behind ours and try to guess at what the people inside were
insights thinking doing. Every evening, the old man moved slowly about his
kitchen.  We could see him quietly in the warm light of the kitchen opening
his refrigerator, going to the stove and back to a table in a routine so
consistent that he seemed like a mechanical figurine in a miniature
Christmas village scenes.

The boys and their mother were less predictable. Lights went on and off in
different rooms and at different times and sometimes stayed on all night.
Often we could see the glow of a television. We could usually see the boys
moving about inside, but we rarely saw their mother.

The old man was named Desmond. We got to know him first. He was from
Barbados, but had lived in American for 30 years. I loved to visit his
house. It was filled with things everywhere you looked. On his shelves
along with books were framed pictures, trophy cups, a rusted metal toy fire
engine, a miniature statue of liberty all carefully placed. There was a
star made of purple and green pipe cleaners hanging from a window latch.
You could ask him about anything from the brass bell with the cracked
wooden handle to the bright green and gold trophy with a figure of a runner
on top and he could tell you a story about how the bell or trophy had found
its way into his life.

There were many of pictures of his wife who had died ten years ago. There
were also pictures of his children who lived on the other side of the
country.  And there were pictures of his sisters and brothers and his
mother and father at weddings and parties. We could tell by the way the
people were dressed which pictures were older and which were more recent
and Desmond would tell us who everyone was and who was nice and who was
funny and who liked to gossip.

As the days became shorter and Winter approached, we insulated exterior
walls where possible and repaired windows and sills. As a further measure
to eliminate drafts, we hung heavy curtains across the windows in every
room. A cast iron stove for heating and cooking remained at the top of our
scavenging list.  

Slowly as our scraping, plastering, smell and touch wore away the detritus
of previous ownership, our house began to feel like home.

Even with all the interior work that needed to be done, there was still
time to work on the garden, that Dad said would feed us come summer. I
enjoyed this work the most. Desmond would often join us making suggestions
about where to dig or what to plant in a voice that was gentle but firm. We
always followed Desmond's advice even when it appeared to conflict with a
directive from Dad.  Desmond had been a gardener for most of his life so we
had reason to trust him, but Dad also listened to Desmond.

As long as I could remember, Dad never had any friends. He never really
even talked with anyone. Dad talked at people or through them or sometimes
completely around them, but with Desmond he listened. After dinner as we
finished the evening choirs, we would see Dad and Desmond talking together
at the dining room table. We were intrigued and would catch some of their
conversation about how the world used to be when they were young

I was fascinated by the boys who lived behind us. During the week, I would
see them leave for school each morning and come home everyday at the same
time. They would always just go straight inside their house.  On the
weekends, they would spend most of their time inside leaving only
occasionally to go to shop for something. Whenever I saw them, I would stop
what I was doing and watch. I had certainly seen other kids before at
school and around our previous neighborhoods, but they lived. They were so
close. They lived on our island as I thought of our block. They never
seemed to notice me or any of us.

I had never had any typical friends. Michael and Wendy
and I spent all of our time together.

We had never really had many outside friends. In the apartment when we went
to school, sometimes Michael or Wendy would bring home a friend, but mostly
we stuck to ourselves. Three seemed like enough. But there was something
intriguing about the boys or at least their circumstance. The were on our
island and seemed unencumbered by the world around them.

One evening in early December, the sound of sirens slowly pulled me out of
sleep. When I opened my eyes the sirens had stopped but the room was alive
with a steady pulse of alternating red and white light that swept across
our ceiling. Michael and I went to the window and could see an ambulance
and police car in front of the boy's house. The house looked bright as if
every light had been turned on. We could see a police officer talking on
his radio. We could hear radio voices from the vehicles barking bits of
information that seemed to have meaning only for their intended audience.
As we watched, a few uniformed men moved about in the house. Finally two
came out carrying a stretcher. A white sheet covered the body which was
inserted into the back of the ambulance. The ambulance left. The police car
stayed for a short while longer and then left. The house once again stood
dark and silent.

In the morning, Desmond came to see Dad. He told him that the boys mother
had died that evening. He said the boys had come to his house to ask for
help when they found their mother awake in the middle of the night and
short of breath. Desmond called the ambulance, but kept the boys with him
at his house. He said that they were both still at his house and sleeping.
From that point forward the boys remained with Desmond. There was no
funeral and no apparent relatives. No one ever spoke of their mom again.

Two days after she died, Wendy and I went with the boys back into their
mom's house to collect their belongings. They each carried a duffel bag
that Desmond had given them. The house was filled with things, but unlike
Desmond's house these things were scattered about without any sense of
purpose. There were clothes, books, toys, empty bags of chips and bottles
of soda, all seeming to rest where they had last been put down and
forgotten. As we followed the boys, I glanced back at Wendy searching for
confirmation of my wonder, but she just looked straight past me.

As we walked with them quietly through the house. They each picked up
things they wanted. Sometimes they held an item in their hand and looked at
trying to determine if it was essential. Although the boys would be living
just next door, there was a sense that we were not coming back. 

The house showed no evidence of death or, at least, of the presence or
absences of their mother beyond that her body no longer inhabited the
house. And yet, I was hesitant to touch anything, as if death was anything
as if a dust of death had contaminated the house. A dust I did not want to
touch or breathe.

For a long time, the house remained empty. No one claimed it. Desmond said
he thought it was owned by her bother who had moved back to the Dominican
Republic many years ago. 

The boys were named Dewayne and Germaine and were younger than me. They
continued going to school during the week and mostly kept to themselves.
Once in a while, we would get them to come over to our yard for a game of
soccer or baseball. They never said very much. It was just that we needed a
few more people play any sport that involved teams.


By December we had noticed lights on in the boy's house in the evening
sometimes staying on all night as if the same chaotic world had once again
moved back in. At first the occupants were quiet but after a week or so
they become more noisy and sometimes (radio) we heard shouts and would
sounded like fights in the middle of the night. One night we woke to a
scream and the sound of broken glass. Our door opened and Dad appeared.  He
told Michael to get dressed and meet him downstairs. A few minutes lated we
saw Dad and Micheal crossing the yard toward the house. Desmond, who had
also been woken by the commotion was coming from his house to meet them.

We could not see them go in the house, but the noise quieted. It was about
an hour later when Dad and Michael and Desmond and girl came around from
the front of the house. The house was dark. The girl did not look well and
rested on Michaels shoulder as they walked back. When we could no longer
see them. Wendy went back to her room and I went back to bed. We could hear
voices downstairs, but I was too exhausted to stay up any longer.

The next morning, I learned that the girl's name was Kate and that she a
group of her friends had been staying at the boy's house. Dad and Michael
and Desmond had made them leave. Dad had decided that we would extend the
fence to enclose the boy's house along with ours and Desmond's. There would
now be only two ways in and out from our gate and Desmond's. 

It was not until the next day that I saw Kate for the first time. She
looked a little older than Michael but it was hard to tell. She sat at the
table in the kitchen. She was thin and tired with a faint smile on her
face. 

By the spring our numbers had grown to twenty living in all three houses.
Dad remained in charge and no one seemed interested in challenging his
authority. Construction continued on the  property. Fences were build. The
garden was cleared and planted. A second water tower was built. We still
drew electricity and water from the outside but Dad felt the time would
come soon when this to could be shut off. We always needed more food and
the kids would head out each evening to find food. They found lots of food
that was being thrown out in dumpsters. It was more than enough to feed
everyone.

Dad never seemed to like that the kids collected food from the trash. He
felt we were not trash pickers and we were never allowed to go out with
them. But we needed the food to keep everyone fed. 

Officer Peterson sat at his desk and thought about the house where he had
found the woman dead in her bed. The house had been littered with kids toys
and clothing and yet there were no kids in the house. The case was closed.
The woman had died of cancer. There was no question of suicide or foul
play. It was an uncomplicated death and the only guilty party was mother
nature herself or whatever diety people choose to rest their faith in. They
had identified the woman as Sandra Diego but could not locate any next of
kin. Had they been unable to identify her more effort would have gone into
the case. But her life ended neatly in way that left no complications. The
body was sent to the morgue and if no one claimed it in 60 days it would be
creamed. The ashes swept into the waste basket.

(and who had called in the 911 call?)
Peterson did not need to think about this case as there was no case. He had
real cases to think about. There were four unsolved murders and
investigations of theft and one for arson. And yet, he kept coming back to
the house where he and his partner had found Sandra. Her face had none of
the pain he had seen in other bodies. She lay in bed and looked peaceful,
an orderly transition to where ever you went after death. But something was
not right. There were children in the house. Just not present in the middle
of the night when she died. There was no suspicion of their involvement so
why had they left and where had they gone. There was no evidence of another
adult living in the house. 

After years of investigations, Peterson was confident that he could walk
into a house and tell with reasonable accuracy the number of people living
in a house, thier ages and genders of the people living in a home and this
one had one mother diseased and two young boys. He mentioned none of this
to his partner and whether she noticed what he did was uncertain. He did
not want to burden her. She was younger, still learning the ropes. To
survive she needed to become adept at compartmentalizing what she found in
the world or she would be overwhelmed by the constant burden of human
tragedy. She needed to go home to her family at night.

He was older. His kids had grown. His own wife had divorced him and moved
away. His work was his life. He could let the humanity that sat on the
periphery of every case seep into his deep consciousness and make a home
there, patiently waiting for a quiet moment when it it found its way into
the forefront of his thoughts.

The home was listed as belonging to a man who lived in Barbados. The number
listed was disconnected. He had the same last name as the woman who had
died. The house would just sit abandoned, like so many houses in the city.
One more did not mater. 

On a quiet afternoon he stopped by the local elementary school just after
students had left. He said he was concerned about a
The secretary was willing to help. Everyone worried about kids
the school notified the police, but he was the police or was he just a
police officer.

Department of family services had decided to pick them up from school.

Peterson called and told Desmond to keep them home from school.

The DFS came to the door of Desmond's house and demanded to have the
children. Desmond refused and said they needed a warrant. That evening
after Dad returned home a meeting was called. Everyone sat in the living
room of our house. Desmond described the history of how Gerard and brother
had come to live with him. Most people knew the story but he was not sure.

Anyone who wanted to leave should leave now. They did not want people
leaving after the police arrived. No one wanted to leave. Alex (a kid) said
he had been through this before at his own house. 




He called family services and had thought more carefully he never would
have done so because the chain of events that moved forward were not

That winter we used gas to heat our house. Early spring we began building
plant beds in the back of the house. We prepared the yard digging the soil.
The work felt good. 

Dad began to share his plans with the old man. We removed the fence between
our houses so that we could expand our garden.

There was always more than enough work to do and Dad hoped that the boys
iiiiiinext door would join us.

I could see the boys going off to school every morning. They would watch us
in the yard or working on the house. 

As soon as the ground thawed, we began digging the garden. James and Darren
had moved into our house. We built a fence. 

The police arrived. They were looking for 

someone fired a gun. The police move in.



********************
He grew plants on the roof. His garden was organized. But the natives would
take things. He wanted to teach them new ways to live. He wanted to make
them into Yankees. He hated their televisions. :w

When he came into the bodega he saw a television set which was not there
when he last visited.  It was for his customers the owner said. He himself
rarely watched, but he could not take his eyes off the screen.

Why did anyone who aspired to any sort of intellectual status feel guilty
about this box. They would deny watching it as if they honestly believed
this. The whole country had moved into a sense of denial as if it were an
epidemic. But had it always been this way? Did people always feel a
conflict between their actual lives and their perceived lives. Was modern
life just filled with more guilty pleasures. 

Even the dog ignores the television. The dogs life seems changed little
since his domestication. In the modern world his freedom is more restricted
but his interaction with the world remains the same.  He sleeps. He eats.
He sleeps without regard for modern light. Still finding his rythm of the
sun. Television sets have not effect on the dog. He rides in cars, but
without intention or car. It is not a great machine of conveyance, but
simply a place to be like any other. He is equally oblivious to his own
mortality yet still shares our instinct for survival. 


We would attend lectures at a local university. The professors rarely
minded the five extra students in their class more than confrontation.
While Dad sometimes just listened, more often than not he would start
asking questions and move the sleepy students into debate. Once sitting in
the back of the room. The professor was engaged in a lecture about
Taylorism. The students sat some slumped in their chairs doodling in their
notebooks, some taking notes, some staring past the professor their mind
working through some unrelated problem. Without waiting for a pause in the
professors lecture, Dad asked "What are the benefits of efficiency?" The
professor stopped unused to interruption. He looked at Dad and seemed about
to ask his name, but at that point Dad rose from his seat, the professor,
responded, "Well they should be self evident."  "How efficient is this?" he
pointed around the room at the students "The seem hardly the most effective
way to deliver information." "Look here" he took a notebook from one of the
students "It appears your lecture has inspired a rather naughty picture. If
that was the intention..well" 

Dad took us to the tops of buildings at night. He would lecture us about
the history of the city pointing out buildings. and the stars.

Once he commandeered a bus and drove everyone home.

He redirected a fruit truck to the neighborhood and had us hand out boxes
of fruit to 

juggled fruit in a supermarket.

We entered a corporate feeding station. Where people wore name tags. He
hated name tags. We walked right into the kitchen. No one cared because
they did had no personal interest. They were just placed there and told to
do their job. The cook staff spoke spanish and Dad immediately began
talking to them. We ate soup and bread. It was late and Dad said they all
wanted to go home from a long day so he instructed us to help clean so
everyone could go home early.

Dad spent most of his days at the factory, but some days Dad would wake us
up early and off we would go with no obvious intention in mind, but knowing
that some sort of adventure was the likely outcome, commandeering a public
bus, freeing animals at the city zoo, inspiring a spontaneous student
revolt at a local university.  Usually these happened on a week day.  He
would say, "No one expects you on a week day."

And so we found ourselves at the zoo. He had never really talked about
zoos, but had used "zoo" or "animals in a cage" as a way of describing.  As
we methodically made our way through each exhibit, Dad would point the
different animals which he knew by species and type without reading the
public descriptions. He would describe the creatures native habitat
including floral, climate and geographic location.  He would tell us the
range of area commanded by each creature in its daily life and migration.
All in stark contrast to their present predicament. 

When we came to the primate exhibit, Michael made faces at the creatures
and Wendy and I laughed. As Dad was describing the life and habitat of
the gorilla to us he suddenly stopped. The gorilla was looking directly at
Dad and Dad was looking back at him and not speaking. The gorilla picked up
her baby and ran to one side of her pen and then the other, sat ate
something from the ground and looked back at Dad. She then left her
daughter and climbed up on a perch made of some sort of scaffolding
probably left over from construction. She looked back at Dad who just
stared. We did not know what Dad saw or why he stopped talking but we knew
enough not to ask. If Dad wanted to tell us something, he would tell us.

For the remainer of our visit Dad sent us on our way to explore while he
wandered silently around the zoo. We stayed for hours till the zoo closed
and were very late to leave watching the keepers close the gates and for
the night. He seemed particularly interested in the rituals of the closing
of the zoo.

That evening at home he began drawing a map of the zoo from memory on a
large sheet of paper that he had taken from. Each of the pens, stables and
houses were carefully drawn to scale. All of the paths and labeled. As I
watched him draw, I knew there was a reason behind his work.

During dinner we talked about the zoo and the animals. Wendy told a story
about a man who had dropped his camera into the crocodile pit. (look up zoo
stories) Dad just listened and smiled.

After dinner he brought us round the map to describe his plan. We were
going to free the gorilla and as many animals as we could reach. He gave no
reason for this adventure. Micheal and Wendy were immediately drawn to the
plan and did not seem to care for an explanation. I knew enough not to ask.

We would enter the zoo in the afternoon about one hour before closing. One
at a time we would enter the snack hut which was closed an hour before the
zoo closed and. The plan was to remain in sight of the snack hut and enter
in ones and twos when no one was looking. It was a weekday so the zoo would
not be that busy. Dad had noted that the back door to the hut remained
opened. 

Once inside we were to commander a large backhoe that was near a
construction area. Dad said these were easy to start and they often left
the keys in the ignition. The plan was to run a cable from the tractor to
the bars of the cage. The cable would be used to pull down the bars of the
cage. Once we had freed the gorillas we would move on to the other pens.
Dad had marked this all on his map. Indicating where we would be at any
point in time. He had made estimates for how long each would take.

The next day at 4pm we were at the zoo.jj

No sooner does the screen pop into her hand than some
nacent idea journey forth, still wet from birth, with a

breathing, comes forth screaming and shouting and
dying. 


We stood watching a girls soccer game. We had been on our way to the
store and I am not sure why we stopped.  It was just one of those
moments were we all seemed to have the same thought at once. The girls
on our side of the field were from the local high school. We didn't
say anything. Dad seemed to be studing the game very carefully. The
local team appeared to be losing. 

Dad then turned to us and said, the problem is that they are not using
their hands. You see, each team is trying to move the ball into the
other team's goals, but if they just used their hands it would be so
much easier. Suddenly the game appeared as silly as a sack race with
girls awkwardly trying to 

Just as the ball came close to where we were standing, Dad ran onto
the field grabbed the ball with his hands and then started running
toward the opposing team's goal. Both referres were blowing their
whistles and moving toward him. The girls just stopped playing and
stood staring at Dad as he ran past them making his way to the goal.
As he flung the ball in the goal, Michael and Wendy let out huge
cheers and I joined in with them.  


Every little trival thought that enters one's head is
immediately sent out into the universe, ideas barely
formed. The cost of transmission too easy. The barrier
too low. No need or time to sit with a thought and work
it out. No time to think at all. The cost of
transmission so small that the merest thought could be
flung into the universe. Television as insidious as it
was, was at least created with some effort. Some work
went into creating the scripts. Some thought went into
working with the actors, albeit for the masses. But we
had traded one medium curated for the masses with
another currated by the masses with no great
improvement. No need for sustained thought. No time for
ideas to be born and die before reaching maturity. No
time for maturity at all. Sustained thinking was no
longer necessary or even possible. 


One day in
school I was given an assignment to create a family tree. Our teacher, Mr.
Baskins showed an example of his own family tree with pictures of many of
his ancestors going back to his great grandparents. It was neatly laid out
with paths that all funneled down to him. He had used a baby picture for
himself which the students thought was funny

I don't recall any close friends from school. I do recall that most of them
had mothers and fathers and some talked about aunts and uncles and
grandparents. These were not familiar to me.

Every second in this factory thousands of mechanical parts are
intentionally coming together 

Every part of a mechanical device is designed to work in coordination. The
spindle drives the rod which turns the disk which moves the piston. Each
process of revolving, sliding, swinging, lifting, catching each produce
their own vibrations.  Each motion transfers its motion to the next. Each
motion produces an even rhythm. The rhythm is intentional. There is a
difference between a machine that goes clack, clack, clack Every time two
mechanical parts meet there is vibration. But man can't design a perfect
machine so he designs 

The teeth against teeth or rollers against slide were either right or
wrong. Each one sounds clear and intentional. 

We learned that their mother was sick. One day I went into their house.
The house was filled with things, but unlike Desmond's house these things
were all over without any sense of purpose. As if they had been left after
use or just fallen into place. Mostly clothes and books, but also toys and
empty bags of chips or bottles of soda. I thought maybe there was a
problem, but Dawyne made no mention of this and just walked through the
house carefully making his way around any obstacles. 
We made our way to the kitchen where Dawyne got some food from their
refrigerator. It was the kind of food that Aleso had sold in his bodega.

After we sat down, we heard a voice from upstairs "Dawyne, Germaine, is
that you? Can you come up for a minute? I need your help." The voice was
strained and sweet. Dawyne answered, "Yes, mom" He looked at both of us as
if to apologize for having to leave the table and went upstairs.

When he returned, I asked if his mom was okay. Wendy shot me a look but I
did not understand why. Dawyne said she was sick and needed a lot of help
and we left it at that. 

That night, I told Dad about her and he said he would talk with Desmond.
