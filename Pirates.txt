As we sat in the shade of the willow tree, Dad pointed out the different
types of boats on the river. None of the boats were very big. They were
mostly sail boats and mostly used as trainers by the local colleges, but
Dad described each one earnestly. He told us which ones were fast and why,
which ones could carry the most cargo and how many crew they each needed.

As he spoke, we paid close attention. Dad was still Dad, even for Michael
my older brother who was almost 15. Dad's arms seemed as strong as tree
limbs and six foot frame seemed as tall as tall could be.

As he gathered us into a circle to describe his plan, I could sense
that something dangerous was about to happen and that there was no way
I could avoid it. Michael and Wendy never seemed scared. It was as if
they and Dad were made of the same material, but I was different. I
sometimes felt like I wasn't supposed to be there, but there was no
where else to go. 

The plan was to capture one of the sail boats, in particular one of
the 21-foot Sonars which Dad described as the most worthy boat on the
river. The only question was how to launch our attack. 

Not far to our left was a sandy spot where a few people were putting their
kayaks into the river. Dad decided that we should wait until one of the
two-person kayaks was left temporarily unattended and then quickly and
quietly commandeer it for our own.

When the moment came, Dad signaled to us move. By the time we reached the
sand we were running full speed. As arranged, I jumped on front and lay
low.  Michael took the front seat and Dad took the back. Wendy pushed hard
from the shore and leap onto the rear of the boat and then lay low as well.
We were quickly underway with Dad and Michael paddling hard. 
   
The other people on the launch area seemed startled by our actions, but
made no attempt to stop us. By the time the couple noticed we had taken
their kayak, we were far out on the river. I could hear their shouts and
glanced back to see them waving their arms in a way that seemed indicate
they felt there must be some misunderstanding.

I could also see the intent faces of Wendy, Michael and Dad who were
looking past me and focused on a single sail boat that Dad had pointed out
as our target. The boat was coming toward us and moving fast in the strong
wind. It was on a slight tack cutting from right to left across our bow.
The two college students piloting the boat tried to make adjustments to
their course in order to avoid us, but we countered each of their moves.

As the students began to notice the seriousness of the situation, they
started to wave us off in an attempt to avoid a collision, but Micheal and
Dad just dug in harder making their intention clear to even the most naive
observer.

By this point, Wendy had moved forward of Dad and we were all three
standing. Wendy and Micheal both barefoot with pants rolled up past their
ankles. Wendy with dark streaks of mud or grease smeared on her face and
Michael with his T-shirt tied roughly about his head.  

A moment before collision, we jumped to their boat with feral screams and
teeth bared. The students dropped their lines and rudder and stood staring
as Wendy and Michael rushed toward them. The both put out their hands in a
half-hearted attempt to defend themselves, but their soft cafeteria-fed
bodies were no match for our sharp hungry frames wielding paddles and
savagery. Wendy and Michael slowly marched them backwards right off the
boat and into the water. They bobbed in their life jackets and in the wake
of the commotion and tried to make their way clear of the boat.

Dad grabbed the rudder and shouted commands. Wendy held the main sheet and
I the jib.  Instinctively we pulled the sails taught as if we had done this
all our lives. The boat swung round quickly facing back out toward the
river and the other boats, and was again underway in a strong wind.
Micheal stood on the bow and with some paper he had found and rolled into
spyglass and he pointed to our next target -- a boat of similar size that
we were no doubt intended to seize and loot. 

But a few moments later, he saw and pointed out a motorized launch leaving
the harbor headed our way. It seemed that word of our adventure had reached
the dock.  Dad immediately changed course and we headed for a stone wall
that bordered the river near a road bridge.  Although the motor boat was
moving fast, we were not far from the stone wall and a metal ladder that
was set into the stone wall leading up to the roadway above. As we
approached, we dropped the sails and Dad guided the boat quickly against
the ladder.

Dad held the ladder while we each scampered up. We left the boat rocking
aimlessly, its sails helplessly flapping the water. When we all reached the
top, Wendy and Michael quickly redressed themselves and we made our way
onto the sidewalk and down into the city streets with only a little
dampness on our clothing to betray our exploit. As we began to feel safe
from pursuit, we slowed our hurried pace and at first Wendy and then
Michael began to laugh, a deep and pure laugh and I laughed too. Dad smiled
but in a way that merely meant, "Job well done."  He kept us moving along
and as the day slowly turned to dusk we made our way home.

I don't remember mom, at least, that is what Michael and Wendy tell me.
They I say I was too young to remember, but I remember sitting at a table
in a kitchen and the sun coming through curtains that seemed so thin as to
barely keep out the light. I remember a woman standing and I remember a
face with dark hair and dark eyes and a smile. I remember her looking down
at me and I remember feeling safe. I have never told this to Michael and
Wendy. This is my memory and I won't let them take it.

The story goes that mom died when were young. After mom died, Dad moved us
to the city and we lived in an apartment which is where my real memories
began. Michael and I shared a room and Wendy had her own room. We lived on
the 34th floor and could look out over the city. Even though our building
was much taller, we could not imagine a better view than the one we had.
Between two buildings we could even see the water. We would spend hours
looking out the window at the city and making up stories about all the
people we saw. 

This was also a time when we still went to school. I liked school. Michael
and Wendy say they didn't, but that is not how I remember it. I used to
stay after school in Mr. Klien's room. He taught social studies and always
stayed late. He had a bin filled with colored pencils and he let me use
them to draw. Sometimes we talked, but mostly I just drew.

Then we stopped going to school and shortly after that we moved. Michael
told us that Dad quit his job so we could no longer live in the apartment
building. I was sad to leave. All my memories of the apartment are happy
ones, bathed in a sense of calm, real or imagined, I am not sure it makes a
difference.

We moved to a neighborhood south of the city where the buildings were not
as tall, so that you could see more of the sky. The streets were filled
with people and vehicles, but here they seemed to move to at a different
sort of rhythm, one that appeared less predictable and consistent.

Our apartment was just above a small store or bodega as it was called in
Spanish. Dad told us that the neighborhood had changed hands a few times
over the past half century. The present residents were mostly Puerto Rican.
Dad said we were Yankees which was a kind of American and as much as Dad
ever said about our heritage. At school other kids had aunts and uncles and
grandparents and places where they were from. We had Dad and that always
felt like enough for us.

Dad spoke Spanish with the natives as he called them. We were living in
their land, part of a patchwork that was now America, won over in battles
so subtle that no one knew they were being fought. He said it was better to
learn to adapt than to fight change...?

That evening after we returned home Dad went down to the bodega. He often
spent time talking to Mr. Santana who owned the store and our apartment. A
few weeks earlier, Mr. Santana had put a television in his store and Dad
could not stop trying to convince him to get rid of it. Mr. Santana would
tell Dad that he just put it in for his customers. He said they liked to
watch the football matches. 

Dad hated television. He called it the idiot box. 

thought that television was the root of
American sloth. 



Days since we stopped going to school were mostly....

He grew plants on the roof. His garden was organized. But the natives would
take things. He wanted to teach them new ways to live. He wanted to make
them into Yankees. He hated their televisions. :w

When he came into the bodega he saw a television set which was not there
when he last visited.  It was for his customers the owner said. He himself
rarely watched, but he could not take his eyes off the screen.

Why did anyone who aspired to any sort of intellectual status feel guilty
about this box. They would deny watching it as if they honestly believed
this. The whole country had moved into a sense of denial as if it were an
epidemic. But had it always been this way? Did people always feel a
conflict between their actual lives and their perceived lives. Was modern
life just filled with more guilty pleasures. 

Even the dog ignores the television. The dogs life seems changed little
since his domestication. In the modern world his freedom is more restricted
but his interaction with the world remains the same.  He sleeps. He eats.
He sleeps without regard for modern light. Still finding his rythm of the
sun. Television sets have not effect on the dog. He rides in cars, but
without intention or car. It is not a great machine of conveyance, but
simply a place to be like any other. He is equally oblivious to his own
mortality yet still shares our instinct for survival. 


We would attend lectures at a local university. The professors rarely
minded the five extra students in their class. While Dad sometimes just
listened, more often than not he would start asking questions and move the
sleepy students into debate. Once sitting in the back of the room. The
professor was engaged in a lecture about Taylorism. The students sat some
slumped in their chairs doodling in their notebooks, some taking notes,
some staring past the professor their mind working through some unrelated
problem. Without waiting for a pause in the professors lecture, Dad asked
"What are the benefits of efficiency?" The professor stopped unused to
interruption. He looked at Dad and seemed about to ask his name, but at
that point Dad rose from his seat, the professor, responded, "Well they
should be self evident."  "How efficient is this?" he pointed around the room
at the students "The seem hardly the most effective way to deliver
information." "Look here" he took a notebook from one of the students "It
appears your lecture has inspired a rather naughty picture. If that was the
intention..well" 

Dad took us to the tops of buildings at night. He would lecture us about
the history of the city pointing out buildings. 

Once he commandeered a bus and drove everyone home.

He redirected a fruit truck to the neighborhood and had us hand out boxes
of fruit to 

We entered a corporate feeding station. Where people wore name tags. He
hated name tags. We walked right into the kitchen. No one cared because
they did had no personal interest. They were just placed there and told to
do their job. The cook staff spoke spanish and Dad immediately began
talking to them. We ate soup and bread. It was late and Dad said they all
wanted to go home from a long day so he instructed us to help clean so
everyone could go home early.

And so we found ourselves at the zoo. He had never really talked about
zoos, but had used "zoo" or "animals in a cage" as a way of describing.  As
we methodically made our way through each exhibit, Dad would point the
different animals which he knew by species and type without reading the
public descriptions. He would describe the creatures native habitat
including floral, climate and geographic location.  He would tell us the
range of area commanded by each creature in its daily life and migration.
All in stark contrast to their present predicament. 

When we came to the primate exhibit, Michael made faces at the creatures
and Wendy and I laughed. As Dad was describing the life and habitat of
the gorilla to us he suddenly stopped. The gorilla was looking directly at
Dad and Dad was looking back at him and not speaking. The gorilla picked up
her baby and ran to one side of her pen and then the other, sat ate
something from the ground and looked back at Dad. She then left her
daughter and climbed up on a perch made of some sort of scaffolding
probably left over from construction. She looked back at Dad who just
stared. We did not know what Dad saw or why he stopped talking but we knew
enough not to ask. If Dad wanted to tell us something, he would tell us.

For the remainer of our visit Dad sent us on our way to explore while he
wandered silently around the zoo. We stayed for hours till the zoo closed
and were very late to leave watching the keepers close the gates and for
the night. He seemed particularly interested in the rituals of the closing
of the zoo.

That evening at home he began drawing a map of the zoo from memory on a
large sheet of paper that he had taken from. Each of the pens, stables and
houses were carefully drawn to scale. All of the paths and labeled. As I
watched him draw, I knew there was a reason behind his work.

During dinner we talked about the zoo and the animals. Wendy told a story
about a man who had dropped his camera into the crocodile pit. (look up zoo
stories) Dad just listened and smiled.

After dinner he brought us round the map to describe his plan. We were
going to free the gorilla and as many animals as we could reach. He gave no
reason for this adventure. Micheal and Wendy were immediately drawn to the
plan and did not seem to care for an explanation. I knew enough not to ask.

We would enter the zoo in the afternoon about one hour before closing. One
at a time we would enter the snack hut which was closed an hour before the
zoo closed and. The plan was to remain in sight of the snack hut and enter
in ones and twos when no one was looking. It was a weekday so the zoo would
not be that busy. Dad had noted that the back door to the hut remained
opened. 

Once inside we were to commander a large backhoe that was near a
construction area. Dad said these were easy to start and they often left
the keys in the ignition. The plan was to run a cable from the tractor to
the bars of the cage. The cable would be used to pull down the bars of the
cage. Once we had freed the gorillas we would move on to the other pens.
Dad had marked this all on his map. Indicating where we would be at any
point in time. He had made estimates for how long each would take.

The next day at 4pm we were at the zoo.jj

No sooner does the screen pop into her hand than some
nacent idea journey forth, still wet from birth, with a
no more instinct than that necessary for blinking and
breathing, comes forth screaming and shouting and
dying. 


We stood watching a girls soccer game. We had been on our way to the
store and I am not sure why we stopped.  It was just one of those
moments were we all seemed to have the same thought at once. The girls
on our side of the field were from the local high school. We didn't
say anything. Dad seemed to be studing the game very carefully. The
local team appeared to be losing. 

Dad then turned to us and said, the problem is that they are not using
their hands. You see, each team is trying to move the ball into the
other team's goals, but if they just used their hands it would be so
much easier. Suddenly the game appeared as silly as a sack race with
girls awkwardly trying to 

Just as the ball came close to where we were standing, Dad ran onto
the field grabbed the ball with his hands and then started running
toward the opposing team's goal. Both referres were blowing their
whistles and moving toward him. The girls just stopped playing and
stood staring at Dad as he ran past them making his way to the goal.
As he flung the ball in the goal, Michael and Wendy let out huge
cheers and I joined in with them.  


Every little trival thought that enters one's head is
immediately sent out into the universe, ideas barely
formed. The cost of transmission too easy. The barrier
too low. No need or time to sit with a thought and work
it out. No time to think at all. The cost of
transmission so small that the merest thought could be
flung into the universe. Television as insidious as it
was, was at least created with some effort. Some work
went into creating the scripts. Some thought went into
working with the actors, albeit for the masses. But we
had traded one medium curated for the masses with
another currated by the masses with no great
improvement. No need for sustained thought. No time for
ideas to be born and die before reaching maturity. No
time for maturity at all. Sustained thinking was no
longer necessary or even possible. 


One day in
school I was given an assignment to create a family tree. Our teacher, Mr.
Baskins showed an example of his own family tree with pictures of many of
his ancestors going back to his great grandparents. It was neatly laid out
with paths that all funneled down to him. He had used a baby picture for
himself which the students thought was funny

I don't recall any close friends from school. I do recall that most of them
had mothers and fathers and some talked about aunts and uncles and
grandparents. These were not familiar to me.
