As we sat in the shade of the willow tree, Dad pointed out the different
types of boats on the river. None of the boats were very big. They were
mostly sail boats and mostly used as trainers by the local colleges, but
Dad described each one as seriously as if it could carry a man across the
ocean. He told us which ones were fast and why, which ones could carry the
most cargo and how many crew they each needed.

As he spoke, we paid close attention. Dad was still Dad, even for Michael
my older brother who was almost 16. Dad's taught muscled arms seemed as
strong as steel and six foot frame seemed as tall as tall could be.

As he gathered us into a circle to describe his plan, I could sense that
something dangerous was about to happen and that there was no way I could
avoid it. Michael and Wendy never seemed scared. It was as if they and Dad
were made of the same material, but I was different. I sometimes felt like
I wasn't supposed to be there, but there was no where else to go. 

The plan was to capture one of the sail boats, in particular one of
the 21-foot Sonars which Dad described as the most worthy boat on the
river. The only question was how to launch our attack. 

Not far to our left was a sandy spot where a few people were putting their
kayaks into the river. Dad decided that we should wait until one of the
two-person kayaks was left temporarily unattended and then quickly and
quietly commandeer it for our own.

When the moment came, Dad signaled to us move. By the time we reached the
sand we were running full speed. As arranged, I jumped on front and lay
low.  Michael took the front seat and Dad took the back. Wendy pushed hard
from the shore and leapt onto the rear of the boat and then lay low as well.
We were quickly underway with Dad and Michael paddling hard. 
   
The other people on the launch area seemed startled by our actions, but
made no attempt to stop us. By the time the couple noticed we had taken
their kayak, we were far out on the river. I could hear their shouts and
glanced back to see them waving their arms in a way that seemed indicate
they felt there must be some misunderstanding.

I could also see the intent faces of Wendy, Michael and Dad who were
looking past me and focused on a single sail boat that Dad had pointed out
as our target. The boat was coming toward us and moving fast in the strong
wind. It was tacking at a slight angle to our course cutting from right to
left across our bow.  The two college students piloting the boat tried to
make adjustments to their course in order to avoid us, but we countered
each of their moves.

As the students began to notice the seriousness of the situation, they
started to wave us off in an attempt to avoid a collision, but Micheal and
Dad just dug in harder making their intention clear to even the most naive
observer.

By this point, Wendy had moved forward of Dad and we were all three
standing. Wendy and Micheal both barefoot with pants rolled up past their
ankles. Wendy with dark streaks of mud she had managed to smear on her face
and Michael with his T-shirt tied roughly about his head.  

A moment before collision, we jumped to their boat with feral screams and
teeth bared. The students dropped their lines and rudder and stood staring
as Wendy and Michael rushed toward them. They both put out their hands in a
half-hearted attempt to defend themselves, but their soft cafeteria-fed
bodies were no match for our sharp hungry frames wielding paddles and
savagery. Wendy and Michael slowly marched them backwards right off the
boat and into the water. They bobbed in their life jackets and in the wake
of the commotion and tried to make their way clear of the boat.

Dad grabbed the rudder and shouted commands. Wendy held the main sheet and
I the jib.  Instinctively we pulled the sails taught as if we had done this
all our lives. The boat swung round quickly facing back out toward the
river and the other boats, and was again underway in a strong wind.
Micheal stood on the bow and with some paper he had found and rolled into
spyglass and he pointed to our next target -- a boat of similar size that
we were no doubt intended to seize and loot. 

But a few moments later, he saw and pointed out a motorized launch leaving
the harbor headed our way. It seemed that word of our adventure had reached
the dock.  Dad immediately changed course and we headed for a stone wall
that bordered the river near a road bridge.  Although the motor boat was
moving fast, we were not far from the stone wall and a metal ladder that
was set into the stone wall leading up to the roadway above. As we
approached, we dropped the sails and Dad guided the boat quickly against
the ladder.

Dad held the ladder while we each scampered up. We left the boat rocking
aimlessly, its sails helplessly flapping the water. When we all reached the
top, Wendy and Michael quickly redressed themselves and we made our way
onto the sidewalk and down into the city streets with only a little
dampness on our clothing to betray our exploit. As we began to feel safe
from pursuit, we slowed our hurried pace and at first Wendy and then
Michael began to laugh, a deep and uncontrollable laugh. I laughed too.
Dad smiled but in a way that merely meant, "Job well done."  He kept us
moving along and as the day slowly turned to dusk we made our way home.

I don't remember mom, at least, that is what Michael and Wendy tell me.
They I say I was too young to remember, but I have a memory of sitting at a
table in a kitchen and the sun coming through the curtains, curtains so
thin as to barely keep out the light and beside me is a woman and her hair
is dark and long and her skin is pale and she is standing next to me, just
standing and she is my mother. I have never shared this memory with Michael
and Wendy. It is mine and they cannot take it.

The story goes that mom died when were young. After mom died, Dad moved us
to the city and we lived in an apartment which is where my real memories
began. Michael and I shared a room and Wendy had her own room. We lived on
the 34th floor and could look out over the city. Even though our building
had many more floors above ours, we could not imagine a better view than
the one we had. Between two buildings we could even see the water and boats
passing out to sea. We would spend hours looking out the window at the city
and making up stories about all the people we could see in the buildings
around us.

This was also a time when we still went to school. I liked school. Michael
and Wendy say they didn't, but that is not how I remember it. I remember
staying after school in Mr. Klein's room. Mr. Klein taught social studies.
He had white hair and wore checked shirts. He had a box filled with colored
pencils and after school he let me use them to draw. Sometimes we talked,
but mostly I just sat and drew pictures.

Then we stopped going to school. For a while Dad took us lectures at the
local university. The professors rarely seemed mind the five extra students
in their class. While Dad most often just listened, he would sometimes
start asking questions and move the sleepy students into debate. Once
sitting in the back of the room. The professor was engaged in a lecture
about Taylorism. The students sat some slumped in their chairs doodling in
their notebooks, some taking notes, some staring past the professor their
mind working through some unrelated problem.  Without waiting for a pause
in the professors lecture, Dad asked "What are the benefits of efficiency?"
The professor stopped, unused to interruption.  He looked at Dad and seemed
about to ask his name, but at that point Dad rose from his seat. The
professor, intimidated responded, "Well that should be self evident."  "How
efficient is this?" Dad pointed around the room at the students "This seems
hardly the most effective way to deliver information." "Look here" he
lifted a notebook from a student sitting in front of him "It appears your
lecture has inspired a rather naughty picture. If that was the
intention..then well..." The students all laughed, but Dad had not intended
it as a joke. To him it was simply another problem that needed to be fixed.

Shortly after that we moved. Michael told us that Dad quit his job so we
could no longer live in the apartment building. I was sad to leave. All my
memories of the apartment are happy ones, real or imagined, I am not sure
it makes a difference.

We moved to a neighborhood south of the center of the city where the
buildings were not as tall, so that you could see more of the sky. The
storefronts advertised auto repair, clothing, televisions, liquor and
hardware. Their facades were colorful and worn. Some stores seemed to sell
just about everything, their entrances bursting with assorted wares.

Our apartment was just above a small store or bodega as it was called in
Spanish. Dad told us that the neighborhood had changed hands a few times
over the past half century. The present residents were mostly Puerto Rican.
Dad said we were Yankees which was a kind of American and as much as Dad
ever said about where we were from.

Dad spoke Spanish with the natives as he called them. We were living in
their land, part of a patchwork that was now America, won over in battles
so subtle that no one knew they were being fought. He said it was better to
know the enemy than to fear them.

That evening after we returned home Dad went down to the bodega. He often
spent time there talking to Mr. Santana who owned the store and our
apartment.  The store was small and cramped and sold a variety of packaged
food and assorted other items such as pencils, balloons and bags of toy
soldiers. A few weeks earlier, Mr. Santana had put a small television in
his store. Dad was continually trying to convince him to get rid of it.
Mr. Santana told Dad that he just put it in for his customers. He said they
liked to watch the football matches. But every time we visited the store
Mr. Santana always seemed to be staring at the screen.

Dad hated television. Sometimes if we were walking in the evening and saw a
television screen through a window in a house, he would stop us and point
out how dead the people looked, their faces illuminated in dull blueish
glow. We would stand there watching them watch TV and he would say "They
might as well be dead and they don't even know it."

Dad also disliked any contraptions, as he called them, that made people
lazy or stupid and this included everything from air conditioners to ice
makers.  But Dad had a knack for fixing things and it was these very sorts
of contraptions that Dad was often employed to fix by Mr.  Santana, who
would come to our door asking for Dad when just about anything in his store
or building was broken. Dad would grumble that if it weren't for him
nothing in this place would work and that might just be good thing.  But he
always went along with Mr. Santana and often returned complaining "Don't
know how people can live in world they can't fix."

Soon after we arrived, Dad got a job at a small factory that manufactured
lace. The kind of lace that was found on curtains and women's clothing. Not
that we knew much about lace or women's clothing, but that was what was on
display in the dusty glass cabinets inside the entrance to the factory.

The factory was housed on one floor of a large two-story brick building and
had been in business for over 70 years. It was owned by two old men who
were brothers and who had inherited the business from their father and who
had remained throughout the neighborhood's cultural transitions. 

Dad got the job one afternoon when we were exploring our new neighborhood.
One of the old men who owned the factory was showing us around the factory
floor which housed more machines than people. We were standing next to an
older woman who was bent over trying to remove a tangle of thread that had
gotten wrapped around a part of the machine where it was not supposed to be
wrapped. The old man complained that they used to have a repair person on
staff, but now it would take weeks to find someone who could come to the
factory and repair a machine.  

Dad bent over and began helping the woman remove the tangled thread.  He
then began to quietly inspect the machine while we all just stood and
watched.  He told the man he could repair the machine for him and then told
us to run along and he would met us back at home later. The old man looked
at Dad for a moment, not sure what to make of him, but then shrugged his
shoulders as if to say he was not sure what to make of anything anymore or
maybe wondered if there was any point in trying. He then turned us smiled,
nodded and then walked us to the door and said good bye.

It took Dad the whole afternoon to get the machine back up and running. He
had to manufacture a replacement part in the factory's machine shop which
Dad said, looked like it had not been used in 20 years. 

From that point forward, Dad spent most of his days at the factory making
up for over a decade of neglect he often said. Though whenever we dropped
by the factory, we would as often find Dad on the factory floor as in the
office with the two old brothers, trying to convince them to make this or
that improvement, but the old men had been doing things the same way for
too long to make this or that improvement. They would listen to his pitch,
but in the end usually decided in favor of keeping things the way they
were.

One morning when we arrived we found Dad standing quietly on the factory
floor. When he saw us he raised his hand for us to stop and said, "Quiet.
Listen. What do you hear?" Not knowing what we were listening for, but
wanting to provide an answer Micheal said, "Weaving machines?" "A machine
is not working properly. Can you tell which one?" He asked. "You need to
listen carefully."  

To me the factory always sounded like a thousand typewriters all
perpetually typing a thousand different manuscripts. But Dad heard
something different. He said, "Machines are designed by man and man
can't design something except by intention. Just as you can look at any
object in nature and know that it is damaged, even one you have never
seen before.  God, like man, does not intentionally design imperfection.
And imperfection has a sound as distinct as..." 

"Listen." he said again and walked us to one of the lace making machines
and pointed out a small rod that had come lose on one end and was now
lazily knocking into a nearby strut every time the spindle to which it was
still attached made a rotation.

With Dad at the factory, we spent most days out on our own. Michael usually
set the agenda. For weeks we mapped the city's sewer system. We tried to
reach the roofs of the tallest buildings in the city. We built a tree fort
in a local park. We often spent rainy days in the library reading though
during one period of rainy days we played hide and seek until we were asked
to leave. 

Our days were punctuated only by breakfast and dinner, which we had at the
same time each day with Dad, and we were responsible for gathering and
preparing food for every meal. Dad provided Michael with money each week,
which was never quite enough to cover what we needed by conventional means.
It was understood that we needed to obtain food however we could and no
questions would be asked. We knew where and when to find still fresh bread
tossed in a dumpster behind the bakery shop as well as produce behind the
grocery store and how to negotiate with the sellers at the close of the
outdoor markets.

The first spring after we arrived, Dad began building a garden on the roof
of our building. Dad's garden did not look like any garden we had seen
before. It was special, Dad said, because it did not require soil and could
grow plants faster and larger than conventional earth gardens. The garden
was made from long pieces of gutter and pipe that he found or retrieved
from the factory.  The gutter and pipe formed a continuous track that wound
its way around the entire roof starting eight feet above the roof and fixed
to the side of a brick chimney down to a wide and shallow water tank
resting directly on the roof.  The plants, initially herbs and tomatoes
grew in the gutter. Water flowed continuously through the system carried
down by gravity and back up by a pump. In the tank were small fish which
Dad said provided the nutrients that the plants needed to grow.

In order to get water on our roof, Dad had tapped a spigot into a water
pipe on the neighbor's roof and used a hose to reach our roof. When the
woman who owned the apartment next door saw what Dad had done she yelled at
him saying that he was stealing her water. Dad said that it was not much
water and that he was creating a garden for the community and would build
one on her roof if she liked. She said he was crazy and should stop messing
around on the roofs of buildings. But for all her complaints, she never
shut off the water.

Over time, the garden began producing peppers and squash and lettuce as
well as tomatoes and herbs. It was sometimes more vegetables than we
could eat and Dad would share the extra produce with neighbors, though
in exchange they had to listen to him pitch his vision for soil-less
gardens on all the roofs of the neighborhood. He would say, "We can feed
the whole neighborhood with real food and not be dependent on whatever
comes in those metal cans and plastic bags that Mr. Santana passes off
as food in his bodega." 

When he told this to Mr. Santana, he just laughed and said, "Do you eat
only what you grow on the roof?" Dad said, "No" but he said he had proved
it was possible. Mr. Santana laughed again, "then come back and talk to me
when you can grow a bag of potato chips. Because that is what people want
to eat." 

Dad's vision for transforming the neighborhood went beyond just roof top
gardens. At night he worked on detailed plans that including cisterns for
collecting water, orchards for growing fruit in the middle street and
furnaces to generate heat from waste. His plans took the form of detailed
and scale drawings of the neighborhood that he created on sheets of paper
that together formed a map that draped over the side of our dinning room
table. Each feature and building was carefully drawn with colored pencils
and included detailed descriptors of their purpose. At night when he worked
on the plans, I would the world came alive under his hand.

Once after dinner, he brought up Mr. Santana to show him the plans. After
listening to Dad, Mr. Santana smiled, shook his head and said it sounded
like what the communist rebels told the people in his village, before they
started kidnapping the boys and stealing their food.

Late one summer evening while we were finishing the dishes, we heard Dad
and another voice shouting on the roof. We went up and found Dad arguing
with the neighbor's son. The boy who looked about 20 years old, was holding a
bag of vegetables that he had collected from Dad's garden. Dad called him a
thief and demanded that he return them. The boy said, "How can you call me
a thief when you steal our water to raise your plants." He then added
something in Spanish that I took to mean that he thought Dad was crazy.

Dad closed the gap between them till they were standing just inches apart,
the boy a inch or so shorter than Dad stood in shorts and a tee-shirt that
hung from his lean frame. I could see the boy's clenched fists, the muscles
in his jaw flexing as he stood stiff and looked straight at Dad.  

Dad reached for the bag with his right hand. The boy pulled the bag out of
Dad's reach and stepped back. The boy dropped the bag and with his right
and swung at Dad. Dad leaned back out of the path of his fist and then came
forward pushing the boy now off balance. The boy fell back landing sharply
against a roof vent and then onto the roof itself. He slowly got up and
wiped blood from his forehead. He shouted something at Dad in Spanish that
we did not understand and walked back to the stair entrance on his side of
the roof. Dad stood their watching him go but did not respond. Dad picked
up the bag of produce and we all went down stairs.

That evening before going to bed no one spoke much. Sometime after midnight
I woke to the sound of metal being smashed and the whoops and cries of
different voices. The sound was coming from the roof. I could tell Michael
was already awake. I looked over at him, the light from the street
outlining his profile. He did not return my look and he said nothing. 

The next morning the three of us went up on the roof and found Dad's garden
completely ruined. Broken pipes and gutter lay scattered about.  Some of
the pipes had even been thrown from the roof to the street below. The
vegetables and plants were crushed. The tank lay upside down and the fish
dead on the roof. We never saw Dad go back on the roof after that evening
and he never spoke about the incident.

The following night a rock was thrown through our window while we were
eating dinner. Michael and Wendy ran to the window, but could not see
anyone in the street. We all looked back at Dad who was still sitting at
the table. He looked at Michael and said, "Make sure to clean up all the
glass and place a piece of cardboard over the broken section of window." He
then got up to get his coat and left. 

We did not see him again until the next morning at breakfast when he told
us that we should pack up our clothes and be ready to leave the apartment
by the time he returned that evening.

That day we quietly packed up everything we could carry with us. Wendy and
Michael had backpacks and I had a duffel bag to which I had sewed shoulder
straps with Wendy and Michaels help. That evening we left the apartment
without even saying good bye to Mr. Santana. Dad said he would come back to
get anything we needed and could not carry with us.

We boarded a bus at the end of our street. The interior was lit with a
starch white glow, more bright than seemed necessary for the late hour of
the evening. The passengers included a few sleepy men and women coming home
from the sort of jobs that cleaned and feed the sort of people whose
workday had long since ended.  At the back of the bus sat a tight group of
restless teenagers. They all seemed a little older than Michael and Wendy.
They laughed as a girl, sitting on a boy's lap, was unable to keep her
balance whenever the bus accelerated or changed direction.  

The bus took us deeper into the urban sprawl until the gleaming glass and
steel towers of the city center were lost from view. It turned onto a busy
street full of people and lights and noise. The teenagers tumbled off
laughing and teasing each other and quickly disappeared into the crowd. The
bus continued on leaving the commotion of the street behind. A few minutes
later we were travelling down a wide street in a quiet neighborhood.
Nearing an intersection with no apparent distinguishing features, Dad
indicated that the next stop was ours. 

As the bus drove away, we found ourselves standing on a dark and unfamiliar
sidewalk carrying almost everything we owned on our back while Dad took his
bearings. A few houses had lights on inside. Many did not. Some had their
windows covered with plywood and looked liked they had not been lived in
for years. The street light across the street flickered a few times and
then went out joining most of the other street lights on the street.

As we walked, we passed a few people sitting on their stoops or leaning
around a car in the warm summer night. The people we passed mostly ignored
us. A few cars drove by. Some came by slowly, their windows down and
playing loud music. Sometimes we heard someone call out and could not tell
if they were addressing us. Either way, we made no attempt to respond and
kept moving forward.

We walked for about 10 blocks until we came to a house set back off the
street. It stood on a small rise, above and apart from the other houses in
the neighborhood. The house seemed to loom over us, a boxy structure as
wide as it was tall. All of the windows on the first floor had been boarded
up.  Some of its shutters hung at odd angles and some were missing all
together. It did not look happy to see us and wore a weary expression that
said I have lived alone for a long time and I am too tired for this.

Without a word, Dad led us through the iron gate and up to the front porch
where we stood while Dad worked a large latch that held the double doors
shut. The street was quiet except for the sound of dog in the distance
barking at an intruder or some other perceived threat. 

Inside the foyer the house was pitch dark. As Dad knelt and fished through his
backpack, I could just make out a set of stairs directly ahead of us that
led to the upper floors. From a window on the second floor landing, a beam
of moonlight shown down to where we were standing and in it floated a storm
of dust particles animated after years of slumber by our sudden entry.

Dad turned on a flashlight and we carefully made our way around the first
floor identifying what appeared to be a dinning room, kitchen and living
room. The beam from Dad's flashlight illuminated few pieces of furniture
and walls of cracked and pealing plaster, but missed small creatures that
ran from us across the floor and into the cracks in the walls.  

Dad then led us up the stairs and into the first room at the top of the
stairs. The room was bare of furniture, but it felt like it had been a
bedroom.  One window provided dim light from the street. We put down our
packs and Dad placed a large handkerchief on the floor. He brought some
bread and cheese and water from his bag and we sat and ate quietly. As we
ate, Dad stood silently looking out the window and surveying the
neighborhood. 

After we finished, Dad said, "Okay, time to get some rest. We are going to
have a big day tomorrow." We instinctively looked for where we were
supposed to sleep but the room was a box without feature, so we lay close
to together and tried to find comfort on the hardwood floor resting our
heads on a shirt or sweater retrieved from our packs. I was the last to
fall asleep that night. I lay awake too anxious to close my eyes thinking
over the journey that led us here and the journey that lay ahead until
finally sleep overcame me. 

The next morning we all rose early, as through the window that provided dim
light from the street that night, now came streaming the unfiltered morning
sun. As we woke Dad was standing by the window looking out. He turned to us
and said, "Who needs to use the bathroom?" smiling as he knew his question
would have its intended effect. "The bathroom is down the hall." he said,
but before we were on our feet, he added, "But the toilet is out of order.
This house has no running water." "It has no gas or electricity for that
matter." He went on. "In fact, it is completely disconnected from the
civilized world." He paused and then added, "Well, the modern world, at
least." As he spoke, we all hoped this would not be one of his long
lectures. "So for the moment, I placed two buckets in the bathroom.  One is
empty and one contains dirt. Place some dirt in the empty bucket and then
use it to relieve yourself then add some more dirt.  Once you are done,
take both bucket into the backyard and bury the contents of one and add
more dirt to the other."

Returning with the buckets, we saw Dad leaning with both hands on the back
porch railing. He looked at us smiling and said, "She's a beaut ain't she?"
We stopped and stood looking up at Dad. Even Michael and Wendy seemed a bit
overwhelmed by all that had happened in the past few days. Shading his eyes
from the low morning sun, Michael asked, "Whose house is this?" "Why this
is our house." said Dad with all the confidence of a used car salesman. "It
was left here, abandoned by its former occupants. Unable to care for it, I
suppose. Needs a little work" He said as he turned to flick a lose paint
chip off the clapboard siding "but sound as can be" he patted the same
piece of clapboard. "Why this house has been standing here since before the
turn of the century" he looked up at the house. As we tried to make sense
of everything he was saying, Wendy asked "Do you think they will want it
back?" "Who will want it back?" Dad asked vaguely still looking up at the
house and as if he sincerely did not understand the question.  "The people
who left it." Wendy added. Dad quickly turned round and growled "Just let
'em try!" He then laughed out loud and Wendy and Michael laughed with him
and then Michael raised his fist and shouted "Hurrah!" joined by Dad and
Wendy in turn.

Dad then took us on a tour of the large back yard pointing out the future
location of a vegetable garden, fruit trees, water tanks, a green house and
a windmill. There was no hesitation in Dad's future. Each of the features
he described felt more real to him than the uneven earth, clumps of weeds
and trash and scrap that presently made up the yard.

After touring the yard, we went back inside and sat around a large table
that seemed like it had been there since the house was first built. Four
miss-matched chairs had been placed around the table. Dad had removed a
couple of boards from one of the windows, so some light could enter. We ate
the remaining bread and cheese from last night. Dad inventoried the state
of the house. In addition to no running water, gas and electricity, he
listed a leaking roof, broken windows and a lack of basic furniture.

It took us three days to establish a working zone of water on the first
floor of the house which included one bathroom and the kitchen. The process
began with shutting off all the water valves we could find and turning them
on one by one starting with the main valve in the street until we found
leaks. Dad would fix the leaks and we would move on to the next leak or
broken pipe. 

Initially our progress was hampered by not having the necessary tools or
materials for whatever we were trying to fix. When we were stuck, Dad would
redirect our efforts to a different project and then head out to find tools
and materials. We did not know where he went, but guessed he was going back
to the factory since nothing he brought home looked new and some tools only
stayed in our house as long as we needed them.

After three days of using the buckets, we were all relieved to have a
working toilet. As we all stood watching the first successful flush, Dad
said, "It took the Romans till 300AD to complete a system of sewers that
carried their waste from the city. Our progress is slow but sure."

Over the remainder of the week, we reconnected the gas stove and brought
power to the refrigerator. There was no plan to bring power any other part
of the house. We were unable to get the hot water tank working which Dad
said was a blessing in disguise. It meant that we would need to continue
taking cold showers. Even in the warm weather, the cold showers felt too
cold. I could not imagine taking a shower as the days got cooler. It also
meant that we would not have gas heat, though Dad said he would work out a
plan for heating the house in the winter and we trusted that he would.

Each morning, as we sat at the table having breakfast, Dad would review
what needed to be accomplished for the day. If it was complicated, he would
provide a detailed drawing showing exact dimensions, placements and listing
materials and instructions. Sometimes he would refer to his map of the
property, constructed on multiple sheets of paper and a continual work in
progress. If a task required a new skill, he would lead us in the effort
himself, though often we worked on our own with Michael in charge.  

Since we always needed more material, one of our evening tasks was
scavenging. Dad kept a running list of items that we needed for the house
including tools, mechanical fittings and furniture. About once a week, we
would head out at night to search abandoned houses, dumpsters or look
through what people left out on the curb. We started to learn which parts
of town were best to find furniture or fittings and when to look.

Over the next couple of months, we repaired the roof, fixed windows, found
furniture, stock piled wood, cleared the yard and cultivated a garden and
as we slowly scraped away the detritus of previous habitation, the house
and property began to feel like ours.

Our house was one of three houses on a small block with each of the three
houses facing out in a different direction like the battlements of a
medieval fort. Our block itself was enclosed by two streets. One street
went straight along one side of our house and the other made a rough arc
meeting the first street at both ends and forming the shape of a capital D.

Our block was an anomaly among the rows of straight streets evenly lined
with houses that made up much of the neighborhood around us. To the north
and toward the city, the land rolled along fairly evenly, but our block was
set in a nook of a large hill that rose so steeply beside us that there
were no other houses across the street and to the south of our house. Dad
said that our unconventional block resulted from the difficult geography of
the land and proved that "man could only get so far in his attempts to
impose order on nature before the very earth itself rebelled."

One of the three houses was a small cottage that sat directly behind our
house and that was so brightly painted that it made the drab houses of the
neighborhood look even more drab. In it lived an old man who spent much of
his time puttering about tending to his garden or bird feeders.

The third house on our block which sat next to the old man's cottage looked
in worse shape than ours, at least from the outside.  If it weren't for the
two boys and their mother that lived there, I would have assumed it was
abandoned. The screen door at the back of the house hung loosely from the
door frame and slapped against the house in the wind. A large hole had been
gnawed into one of the eves by squirrels who lived in the roof with
careless abandon. In the yard there was an old couch, what looked like a
washing machine and the husk of a rusting car.

At night, we could see into both the houses from Wendy's room where we
often gathered after evening chores and before going to bed. As the days
got shorter, we found ourselves gathering in her room earlier and earlier.
Without electric lights, our daily routines were dictated more by the sun
than the clock. Often we would be cleaning up from dinner just as the last
remaining rays of sun light made their way over the horizon. Before going
to bed, we lit candles so that we could see more easily when we brushed our
teeth and made our way upstairs, but we usually blew them out when we got
to our rooms, letting the night into our lives and gathering together in
the dark.

Sometimes we would sit looking out of Wendy's window and into the brightly
lit rooms of the houses behind ours making up stories about what the old
man or the boys were doing. The old man offered little fodder for
invention. Every evening, he moved slowly about in the warm light of his
kitchen, quietly tracing a path between his refrigerator, his stove and a
small dinning table in a routine so consistent that he seemed like a
mechanical figurine in one of those miniature Christmas villages.

The boys were less predictable. Lights went on and off in different rooms
and at different times and sometimes seemed to stay on all night. In one
room, we could usually see the bluish glow of a television. We rarely saw
their mother.

The old man was named Desmond. We got to know him first. He was from
Barbados, but had lived in American for 30 years. I loved to visit his
house. It was filled with things everywhere you looked. On his shelves,
along with books, were framed pictures, trophy cups, a rusted metal toy
fire engine, a miniature statue of liberty. There was a star made of purple
and green pipe cleaners hanging from a window latch. You could ask him
about any item from the brass bell with the cracked wooden handle to the
bright green and gold trophy with a figure of a runner on top and he would
tell you a story about how the bell or trophy had found its way into his
life.

There were also pictures of his wife who had died ten years ago and there
were pictures of his children who lived on the other side of the country.
There were older pictures of his sisters and brothers and his mother and
father at weddings and parties. I could tell by the way the people were
dressed which pictures were older and which were more recent and Desmond
would tell me who everyone was and who was nice and who was funny and who
liked to gossip.

Desmond had been a gardener for most of his life. Though we never asked
for his help, no sooner would we start digging in the dirt when there would
be Desmond slowly making his way across the yard toward us, as if we had
been foolish to think that we could plant a single row of lettuce without
his advice. He directed our efforts with an assured wisdom that we always
followed even when it appeared to conflict with a directive from Dad. We
did this only because Dad listened to Desmond as well.

As long as I could remember, Dad never had any friends. He never really
even talked with anyone. Dad talked at people or through them or sometimes
completely around them, but with Desmond he listened. We would often see
Dad and Desmond standing at some part of the property or in the house
conferring over some aspect of a repair or future project.

The boys who lived behind us were of particular fascination to me, though
it was not because they led any sort of unusual life. In fact, their life
could hardly have been more normal.  Weekday mornings, they left for school
at just the same time each day, walking to catch a bus at the end of the
street. In the afternoon they returned with the same punctuality and went
directly inside their house. On weekends, they would spend most of their
time inside leaving only occasionally to go to the store. Whenever I saw
them, I would stop what I was doing and watch, but they never seemed to
notice me or any of us. It was as if we did not exist, as if our whole
world was invisible to them.

I asked Desmond about them but he would only tell me that their mother was
very sick. He said that he helped her as best he could, but there was not
much that could be done and that nature was taking its unfortunate course. 

Then one evening in late November, the sound of sirens slowly pulled me out
of sleep. When I opened my eyes the sirens had stopped but across our
ceiling swept lights alternating red and then white. Michael and I went to
the window and could see an ambulance and police car in front of the boy's
house. The house seemed to be bursting with light from every window. We
could see a police officer talking on his radio. We could hear voices from
the radios in the police car and ambulance barking odd bits of information
that seemed to have meaning only for their intended audience. As we
watched, a few uniformed men moved about in the house. Finally two of the
men came out carrying a stretcher.  On the stretcher was a body covered in
a white sheet which the men inserted into the back of the ambulance. The
ambulance left.  The police car stayed for a short while longer and then
left. And then, once again the house stood dark and silent.

In the morning, Desmond came to see Dad. He told Dad that the boys mother
had died that evening. He said the boys had come to his house to ask for
help when they found their mother awake in the middle of the night and
short of breath. Desmond went to the house, but by the time he got there he
found their mother had already died. He called an ambulance, but kept the
boys with him at his house. He said that they were both still at his house
and sleeping. From that point forward the boys remained with Desmond. There
was no funeral and no apparent relatives and no one ever spoke of their mom
again.

Two days after she died, Wendy and I went with the boys back into their
house to collect their belongings. They each carried a duffel bag that
Desmond had given them. The house was filled with things, but unlike
Desmond's house these things were scattered about without any sense of
purpose. There were clothes, books, toys, empty bags of chips and bottles
of soda, all seeming to rest where they had last been put down. 

The house showed no evidence of death beyond the absence of their mother
whose body I knew had rested there until only a few days ago. And yet, I
was hesitant to touch anything. It was as if the house was contaminated
with death like a poison dust that I did not want to touch or even breathe.

It was Wendy's job to make sure the boys collected an appropriate amount of
clothing to wear. Beyond that they each picked up things they wanted to
take. They would pick up an object and hold it in their hand, examining it
quietly and carefully trying to determine if it was something worth keeping
like a shell they had just found on the beach. Although they would be
living just next door, there was a sense that we were not coming back. 

For a long time after their mother's death, the house remained empty. No
one claimed it. Desmond said he thought it was owned by her bother who had
moved back to the Dominican Republic many years ago. 

The boys were named Dominic and Jordan and were both younger than me. They
continued going to school during the week and mostly kept to themselves.
When I visited Desmond's house sometimes Desmond would call them down from
their room as if I had come for the purpose of seeing them. They would make
their way down the stairs, Dominic the older one, followed by Jordan, but
mostly we would just stand there looking at each other not knowing what to
say. 

It was around December that we began to notice people going in and out of
the boy's house. At night we would sometimes see lights on, usually in the
same room on the second floor. At first the new occupants remained fairly
quiet but after a couple of weeks we would sometimes hear a radio playing
and an occasional loud cry that was hard to distinguish between anguish or
glee. 

Then one night just after going to bed, I woke to the sound of shouts and
screams and then what sounded like glass breaking. Our door opened and Dad
appeared. He woke Michael and told him to get dressed and meet him
downstairs. 

After Michael left, I went into Wendy's room. She was already at the
window. Together we saw Dad and Micheal crossing the yard to meet Desmond,
who also disturbed by the commotion and was coming from his house to join
them.  Shortly after they disappeared around the front of the house, the
shouting stopped and for about a half an hour the house remained quiet. 

Finally, we heard the front door open and close a few times. A few minutes
later, there were four people returning toward our house, Desmond, a
stranger and for a moment in the dark I could not distinguish Dad from
Michael whose gate and stature now matched Dad's one for one. As they got
closer, I could see that the stranger was a girl with short hair. She had
her arm around Michael's waist and was leaning on him as she walked. 

We heard them enter the house and downstairs we could hear the familiar
voices mixed the new and unfamiliar voice of the girl. I went back to my
room and got into to bed. I lay there unable to sleep until Michael
returned. I did not ask him any questions and did not close my eyes until
after I could hear the rhythmic breathing of his body asleep.

The next morning at breakfast no one mentioned the events of the previous
night. The girl was apparently still asleep in a room. After Dad left,
Wendy finally asked Michael what happened. He said they found two boys and
a girl at the house. The two boys were arguing with each other and the girl
was sitting against the wall crying. When they saw us enter the room, one
of the boys came toward, angry and us asking who we were and then without
waiting for an answer started yelling at us to get out.

"We just stood there. Dad told them that they would have to leave or he
would call the police. The second boy started to run at us but tripped on
something on the floor and fell down and then just lay there moaning
quietly.  Dad repeated his demand that they leave the house. The boy who
was standing began yelling at us some more and then stopped and then kicked
his friend who was still on the floor and told him to get up and help him
gather his belongings.  He then yelled at the girl who was still leaning
against the wall crying.  He called her terrible names and told her to get
her stuff together and that they were leaving. Dad said, "No", that she was
staying with us. The one boy stopped and looked at us for a moment as if
trying to understand what Dad had said and then he swore some more and
continued collecting his belongings. It took them a while to gather all
their belongings even though there was not much to gather from a room which
was littered mostly with trash, food and mattresses they had dragged from
the other bedrooms."

"After the boys left, we left with the girl. She was pretty confused, but
she seemed to understand that she was coming with us and not going with her
friends.  After we got home, we put her in the bedroom at the end of the
hall. I guess she must still be sleeping."

Later that afternoon as we worked in the yard repairing a clothes line, I
looked up to see the girl leaning with her elbows on the back porch
railing, her head resting in her hands as she watched us. Soon Wendy and
Michael noticed her as well and we all stopped our work and stood looking
back at her. She smiled and said, "Hey, what are you urchins up to?"
Micheal said, "Oh, uh...hi Kate", "This is Wendy and James, my brother and
sister." We greeted her but made no effort to close the gap that separated
us. "We are repairing a clothes line" said Wendy in answer to her question.
"Well, that seems like a wholesome activity for a crisp fall afternoon."
she smiled. "Do you want to help us?" asked Wendy. She said that she did
not think she was quite strong enough yet, but was sure she would be able
to join us soon.

That evening at dinner everyone was more quiet than usual. Kate looked
tired and did not seem up for much conversation. We all felt a bit awkward
around our new guest. After dinner, Desmond came over and made some tea for
Kate. He brewed it from jars of herbs he brought from his house. As we
cleaned up after dinner, Kate sat in a chair in the living room. She had
wrapped herself in a blanket and seemed to be shivering. Before we finished
our chores, Desmond helped her up to her room.

Over the next week, Kate's health slowly improved. She became more
talkative at dinner. She started to help with our work around the house and
yard. Each morning she joined us at breakfast while Dad talked about plans
for the day. One morning, when he described a plan to build a fence around
all three houses on our block in order to keep out the sort of degenerates
who had camped in the boy's house, she kidded him stating, "You mean people
like me." and then cast a smile at us. We just looked at Dad who,
ill-equipped for dealing with sarcasm, flustered "No, no, I just meant the
boys who had brought you there."

Although Kate sometimes teased Dad, she never argued with him and worked
along side us to complete any task he assigned. In fact, she had quickly
become the defacto leader of our small group taking over the role from
Michael, a role Michael had seeded surprisingly easily to her. One morning
she said, "Okay, gang let's get to work." and that was it. We all still
knew a lot more about how to build a fence, repair a window or just about
anything than she did, but she kept us working and made sure things got
done. 

One afternoon as we all worked on a cold frame to cover a winter garden
plot and constructed from scavenged windows and lumber, Kate stopped what
she was doing and stood quietly looking up at the sky. She then said,
"Everyone lie on the ground." Michael looked at Wendy, but Wendy was
already starting to lie down and so we all followed suit. "Michael, over
here by us." Kate said. Laying there looking up at the bright clouds as
they moved across the deep blue background of sky, the Earth felt, for
once, like the giant orb that it was turning freely and effortlessly
through empty space.

Kate asked, to no one in particular "What do you see?" "Clouds" said
Michael in a tone that was calm and factual as if he were answering a test
question.  "What else do you see?" she asked. "I see the head of a dog with
floppy ears" said Wendy. No one spoke as they either tried to see Wendy's
dog or looked for objects of their own. After a few minutes, Michael said,
"Maybe we should get back to work. Dad wants us to finish the frame by the
time he gets home." Kate made no effort to rise but instead mused, "Did you
ever wish you were so small that people couldn't see you, that you could
walk among the blades of grass and never have to bother with big people
ever again?" As they all continued to stare into the sky, Wendy said,
"James used to wish he was a dog. For months he went around growling and
barking and walking on all fours." This is a story I had heard before, but
is not part of my memory. "I think I want to be a fire fighter." said
Michael, "that seems like a good job." "What does your Dad do?" asked Kate.
"He works in a factory that makes lace for curtains and things." said
Wendy. After a pause, Kate breathed "He certainly is an unusual fellow."
Her statement hung in the air as we tried to make sense of it. Of course we
knew Dad was unusual, it was just not the sort of thing we contemplated.
After a few more quiet minutes, Kate hopped to her feet saying, "Okay
soldiers, lets get back to work. We need to be finished by dinner."

Sometimes when I looked at Kate, I would try to reconcile Michael's image
of the girl crying against the wall in a room she shared with two boys who
used drugs, with the Kate who confidently lead us through our chores each
day.  One early morning when it was just the two of us together, I asked
her if the boys she had lived with had been her friends.  Her face became
serious and she looked past me saying only that it was a bad time.  "What
is different about now?" I asked.  She looked at me and smiled, "Well,
James, now I have you." I smiled back. I could think of nothing more to say
so I said nothing.

One day in the late afternoon and during a wet snow, we heard the sound of
two people entering the house and shaking the snow from their coats. We
had only expected Kate, who still left for the city on her own once in
while. We were all in the kitchen making dinner when Kate came in and said,
"Hey all, this is Jacob." Jacob seemed to be about the same age as Kate. He
had a few days growth of beard and looked pretty hungry. Kate said, "He has
been living on the street for a few days and needs a place to stay." Jacob
smiled shyly. Kate introduced us all and quickly put Jacob to work helping
Michael cut vegetables.

We made conversation and continued our chores as if this was nothing
unusual, though I was worried about what Dad would say when he got home,
but when he arrived just before dinner was ready, he betrayed no sense of
surprise at seeing a new face in the kitchen. After Kate made an
introduction, Dad shook his hand firmly and said said "Welcome" almost as
if Jacob had been expected. He then said that Jacob could stay in Kate's
old room, since Kate had by now moved in with Wendy. By the next morning,
Jacob was seated with us at the breakfast table listening to directives
from Dad for the day's tasks. 

Over the winter more permanent guests arrived. Most followed Kate home. A
few found our house on their own, but would ask for Kate upon arrival.
Most where young like Kate, with a mix of men and women. They quickly
filled our house and then the boy's house. One young man even went to live
with Desmond. 

They arrived hungry, wide-eyed, dirty and clean, bearing a sense of loss or
misfortune along with their belongings tied in a backpack or bag. There was
Lilly, who could no longer pay for college and so had dropped out. There
was Joseph the painter, who I never saw paint a single picture.  There was
David and Sandy who each looked no older than Michael and I suspect had run
away from home. 

Initially our routines remained generally the same only with more bodies to
work and more bodies to feed. Each morning, everyone would gather in the
kitchen. Dad would lead the discussion, describing what structured needed
to be built or what part of the house needed to be repaired. As the size of
the group increased, we moved into and filled the living room with people
spread over furniture, floor and windowsills. 

Dad began setting deadlines for completing every task, though there was
often no identifiable urgency meriting a deadline. Why did the framing of a
root cellar need to be complete by the end of the month when much of our
food was still scavenged or the foundation for our cistern completed the
same week when most of our water still came from the city? It was Dad who
instilled in us a sense of urgency with his vision of the outside world as
increasingly sick, lethargic, corrupt and dangerous. And it was a vision
that we readily accepted. But the real danger was that the outside world
would simply no longer allow us to live on land we did not own using water
we did not pay for.

As winter turned to spring, we finally completed a fence which wrapped
around our entire block or "the island" we now called it. The fence was
built mostly from the existing fencing that had separated all three
properties.  It was almost six feet tall made from a mix of iron and wood
and mostly solid so that it made a formidable barrier between us and
everything that lay outside. 

In addition, we repaired the windows and doors on the boys house as well
insulating and patching interior walls. The house already had working
plumbing on both floors. Though the hot water heater, which was found to be
working was, by agreement, disabled. The electricity was also disabled
except to serve the refrigerator on the first floor. The house was now home
to a dozen young people.

Our island was a hive of activity. We all worked seven days a week from
after our morning meeting until sunset. I rarely knew what day it was. In
the evening people talked, played music or games. A few were friendly to me
and we would play Monopoly or cards. Michael and a few others often sat
with Dad looking over plans or discussing details of our progress. Kate
would sit with them or sneak off to a quiet spot to talk with Wendy.
Desmond mostly spent his evenings at his own house. Sometimes I would join
him and he was always happy to see me. He had given up trying to get me to
play with the boys who still kept to themselves and continued to go to
school.

One late afternoon returning from repairing the roof of the shed, I was
tired and ready for dinner. As I entered the kitchen, Kate, Wendy, Jacob
and three others who I knew well were all waiting for me. They stood
quietly together behind the small kitchen table. Kate was holding a small
plate with what looked like a Twinkie and in it a single burning candle. As
I entered they began singing happy birthday. They sang the song softly and
carefully as if the words of the song actually had meaning.

It was the first time in my life that I could remember that anyone had
celebrated my birthday. Wendy, Michael and I all knew the dates of our
birth, we were just not in the habit of doing anything to acknowledge them.

Kate offered me the plate with Twinkie and the burning candle and said,
"Make a wish." It was my first time making a wish and I could not think of
anything to wish for, so I just blew out the candle. "I know it is not a
traditional cake," said Kate, "but I found it myself." she chuckled.
Actually, I found a whole box, so that everyone could have their own.

As spring finally gave way to summer, Officer Peterson Etienne found
himself sitting at his desk and thinking about the house where he had found
the woman dead in her bed. The house had been littered with kids toys and
kids clothing and yet there were no kids in the house. The case was closed.
The woman had died of cancer. There was no question of suicide or foul
play.  It was an uncomplicated death and the only guilty party was mother
nature or whatever deity people choose to rest their faith in. They had
identified the woman as Sandra Diego, but could not locate any next of kin.
Had they been unable to identify her body more effort might have gone into
the case.  But her life ended neatly and in way that left no uncertainty.
The body was sent to the morgue and when it was not claimed after 60 days
it was cremated and the ashes swept into bin along with the ashes of all
the other unclaimed bodies.

Peterson did not need to think about this case as there was no case, and he
had real cases to think about. There were the three unsolved murders, four
investigations of theft and a serial arsonist who had not been caught. And
yet, his mind kept coming back to the house where he and his partner had
found Sandra. Her face had none of the pain he sometimes saw in other
bodies. She lay on her side in bed looking peaceful, an orderly transition
to where ever you went after death.  But something was not right. There
were children in the house. Just not present in the middle of the night
when she died. There was no suspicion of their involvement, so why had they
left and where had they gone? There was no evidence of another adult living
in the house. But who had taken care of her and who had called 911?

After years of investigations, Peterson was confident that he could walk
into a house and tell with reasonable accuracy the number of people living
in a house. He could even tell with reasonable accuracy their ages and
genders and this one had one mother deceased and two young boys. He
mentioned none of these thoughts to his partner. He did not want to burden
her. She was young and still learning the ropes. To survive she needed to
become adept at compartmentalizing what she found in the world or she would
be overwhelmed by the constant burden of human tragedy. She needed to go
home to her family at night.

He was older. His kids had grown and had their own lives. His own wife had
divorced him and moved back to Haiti where she had grown up and lived until
she was a teenager. He was also born there but had moved to the states with
his father when he was two. This city was his home. 

He sometimes took on extra shifts just to for something to do and when he
was not on duty, he would dwell on his cases. He found no need to
compartmentalize.  He could let the humanity that sat on the periphery of
every case seep into his subconsciousness and make a home there, patiently
waiting for a quiet moment to make its way back into the forefront of his
thoughts.

The woman's home was listed as belonging to a man who had moved to Barbados
and shared her last name. The number listed for the owner was disconnected.
The house would just sit abandoned, like so many houses in the city. One
more did not mater. 

That same day, he stopped by an elementary school in the neighborhood near
the woman's home. The school reminded him of the one he went to as a kid
not far from here. He told the secretary that he was looking for two
brothers with the last name Diego and gave the woman's address. She looked
alarmed and said, "Oh, I hope there is nothing wrong." Peterson said, "No,
no." that he was just following up on an investigation regarding a
relative. "Oh" she said as she paused looking at him and trying to fill in
the missing information herself. She then said, "Well, I assume you mean
Dominic and Jordan, but let me check the files to confirm their address." A
moment later she said "Yes." as she held the paper record for one of the
boys and asked if he would like to talk with them. He always surprised by
how accommodating some people could be when confronted with a uniform. "Uh,
yes." he responded, not sure if he really did want to see them but then
wondering why else had he come there.  

The boys were called to the office and shown into a room where he was
waiting. They sat and looked understandably nervous. Their appearance did
not match his imagination, though he was taken by how much the older one
resembled his mother. He asked them general questions about school and what
sports they played. He thought about his own kids and wondered how they
would have responded in a similar situation.  He then asked them who they
lived with. The younger one just looked at the older one who hesitated and
then said they were living with their uncle Desmond. He asked for their
address and the Dominic responded with Desmond's address. He finished the
conversation by telling them to make sure to keep up their grades in school
and the importance of school. It seemed like the right thing for an officer
to say.

As he left the room, the assistant principal was there to meet him. She
introduced herself and asked if there was anything she should be aware of
regarding the boys. Peterson asked if the boys had mentioned that their
mother died.  The assistant principal said that she was not aware of anyone
mentioning this. "Well, they seem to be living with their uncle now." he
said, "so everything should be fine." The assistant principal looked at
him, not sure what to make of this information. He then handed her is card
asked her to call him if there were any concerns. As soon as he left, the
assistant principal made a call to the Department of Child Services (DCS).

Peterson got back into his patrol car and sat wondering if he had done the
right thing. He figured that there was a good chance that the school would
call DCS. He had just wanted to see the children and to confirm a nagging
suspicion. But was it possible to observe without interfering? He
remembered something about that from a high school science class. His mind
wandered. He was frustrated with himself for not thinking things through
more carefully or maybe getting DCS involved was his intention all along.

He did know that the DCS, no matter how benevolently intentioned, could
only view the world under a finite set of human relationships and if one
did not neatly fit in the finite set, it would have to be pressed until it
did.

He drove to the address the boys had provided. As he came to the block
where Desmond lived, he noticed that it had changed a lot since the night
he was there. There was now a solid fence that surrounded all three houses
on the block and inside the fence there was a buzz of human activity. This
must be the place officers had been talking about. There was a rumor going
round the precinct about some sort of walled cult in the city. Walls always
created suspicion and as a police officer it was his job to investigate
what was suspicious. 

He found Desmond's house next to the boy's house but on a different street.
As he walked through the gate, he could see young people working in a
garden plot and others erecting large structure whose purpose was not
obvious to him. At the front door he rang the doorbell and waited.  Desmond
opened the door and said "Can I help you?" Peterson said he was at the
boy's house the night their mother died and was looking into where they
were now living. Desmond acknowledge that the two boys were living with
him. Peterson asked if Desmond was their uncle and he said no but was not
surprised that they said he was. He that he had lived next to her for many
years and helped take care of her while she suffered from cancer. He made a
promise that he would take care of her boys when she died.  Peterson asked
if the boys were happy. Desmond cocked his head to the side and with a
small shrug said, "They have lost their mother." and then added "but yes, I
think they are happy." Peterson said, "Okay. Thank you." He turned to leave
and then stopped half way down the steps, turned back to Desmond, who was
still standing at the door, but could not think of what he wanted to tell
him and then just turned and left. 

A couple of days later Peterson got a call from DCS asking him questions
about the boys. After he hung up, he called Desmond to let him know that
agents from DCS would be coming to his house on Friday. He felt it was the
least he could do.

The next day at the morning meeting, Kate told the group about the planned
visit from DCS. Immediately, a few of the young people shared their own
stories about their experiences with DCS. David said he had been taken from
his mother when he was seven and after she had gone to jail. He said he
lived in a series of foster homes until he came here. Kelly who looked a
little older than Kate said that she had been separated from her older
bother and sister when she was twelve. The general feeling was that DCS
would take the boys from Desmond. It was just what they did. And although
almost none of the group had ever even spoken with the boys, a majority
were in favor of resistance. 

A few voiced concerns that resisting DCS would only bring us more trouble.
But then Dad quieted everyone and looked around the room and said, "They
come for the boys, but who is next?" his gaze stopped at Lilly and David
who were both likely little older than sixteen. "Who among us feels free of
prosecution? Who among us conforms to the standards set by our modern
institutions and corporations?  We are an ugly spot in their perfect world
and when one sees an ugly spot, what other choice does one have but to
remove it?"

I spent much of Friday afternoon near Desmond's house. Around 5pm a man and
a woman emerged from a car and began heading for his gate. Kate and Dad
came out of Desmond's house to meet them. The four of them stood at the
gate talking for a good fifteen minutes and while I was not close enough to
hear what they were saying, I could tell that Kate and Dad were not going
to let them pass.

Then suddenly there was a loud and sharp pop followed by three more in
close succession. The sounds seemed to come from close by and caused
everyone to run for cover. Both the man and the woman ran to their car.
Kate and Dad and ran to Desmond's porch. For the next few minutes the only
sound I heard was a car engine starting and the man and woman driving away.
After a few more minute everyone emerged cautiously back into the open and
began walking toward Dad and Kate who were standing on Desmond's porch.

A frantic discussion ensued about whether the sounds were from gunshots or
firecrackers and where exactly the sounds had come from and who was
responsible, but no consensus was ever reached and no one confessed.  

Twenty minutes later, we heard the sirens that we knew would soon be making
their way to our small fort in the middle of the city. The group was quiet.
Dad said "Anyone who wants to leave, should leave now." No one did.

Dad led everyone to the main house where we could discuss a plan. As we
gathered in the living room, everyone waited for Dad to speak. He said,
"The forces of the outside world will now lay siege to our fort." This was
the first time I had heard him use the term fort.  "They will mistakenly
assume our dependence on their world, because not single one of them could
imagine living a day without a bag of potato chips or their favorite TV
show. Why when their power goes out, fully capable adults have been known
to just curl up and die." He described all the work we had done to make
ourselves independent. "We are prepared to resist for months or as long as
it takes them to give up and head home with their tails between their
legs!" Then he shouted, "Hurrah" and the group echoed back with equal
enthusiasm.

He then asked Michael to bring out the maps and everyone stood around the
table as Dad pointed out the defensive measures we would take. One team was
tasked with patching all remaining gaps in the fence and wedging posts
against the three gates. Another would use as much city water as possible
to further fill our cistern before the city shut off our water supply. A
third would move all food from the refrigerators to our root cellar. Two
people would be stationed at each entrance in rotating shifts every six
hours. Their weapons would be garden implements or planks of wood. Lookouts
would be placed on the top floor or balcony of each house with a similar
schedule of rotating shifts. Runners would communicate messages. All other
operations would remain normal. Finally, there would be no negotiation with
the outside world. There was nothing to negotiate.

Soon after the report of gunshots came in Captain Sean Martin called
Peterson and asked "What do you know about two boys named Dominic and
Jordan from the Sherman Elementary School?" Peterson taken off-guard asked,
"Why, what has happened to them?" "Nothing, at least nothing that we know
yet, but two DCS agents went to pick them up and while talking with some
folks outside their house they heard gunshots that appeared to be coming
from the property." 

He paused, "So why do I hear from DCS that you were investigating these two
boys?" Peterson told him the story and explained that he to had been to the
house. "What did you notice about the people in the compound?  Any evidence
of weapons or military gear?" the captain asked. "No" said Peterson. "They
seemed peaceful." Captain Martin paused as he considered this answer.
"Well, we are treating this a hostile situation and sending a team down
there for assessment." Peterson didn't respond for a moment, but then said
"okay" and decided to head down there himself.

From a front window on the second floor I could see three police cars, and
a large black police van, an ambulance and fire truck. There were also
police cars in front of the other two houses, but the main force had
gathered in front of our house. All of the officers remained either in the
vehicles or behind the doors of their vehicles with their weapons drawn.  

Kate sat next to me and it was the first time I had seen her nervous. I
asked her what she thought would happen. She said, "I don't know. Your
father thinks they will wait out there, so maybe not much." I looked back
out the window at the lights silently flashing red and white. It reminded
me of a carnival we had passed once near the outskirts of the city.

An officer came to their front gate and knocked and waited. After getting
no response he returned to his vehicle. He pulled a bullhorn from his rear
seat and then using the bullhorn demanded that we leave the house
peacefully and promised that we would not be hurt.

I asked Kate if we should leave. She didn't answer. She just kept looking
out the window. In the next moment, we both fell away from the window as
our room was filled with bright white light. When we peaked out again we
could no longer see the vehicles or officers behind the wall of light that
was directed at our house.

In the back of the police van, Captain Martin and his team of special
operations officers stood around a roughly drawn map of the property while
the Captain described his plan for going in. The officer who had used the
bullhorn leaned in the van and said, it's been 15 minutes and no answer.
"Okay" Captain Martin said, "it's time to go." Peterson, who had joined the
team in the van, pulled the Captain aside. It was something only Peterson
could do. Although the Captain was his superior office, Peterson had been
on the force longer than anyone in his precinct including Captain Martin
and had the respect of all the officers. Martian had no choice. He had to
listen to Peterson, but he did not have to agree with him.

Peterson quietly suggested that "Maybe we should just wait a little longer.
Give them some time to think this through." "Wait for what? They are not
even trying to communicate." "Captain, we have been here less than an hour.
It is not like they are going anywhere." But the Captain had already made
up his mind, "We have two kids living with someone who has no apparent
legal custody. We have DCS agents who were barred entry and reports of
possible gun shots. We have about two dozen people occupying property that
is not theirs to occupy. I don't think we need much more reason. Besides If
don't go in soon the press will show up with their circus tents and then we
will be here all night. The only reason they are not here now is because of
the fire on Eastside. We need to get this over with."

As they gathered their gear, Martin smiled at Peterson "Don't worry, we are
not going to shoot anyone one unless they shoot first." Peterson looked at
the assault team in their military uniforms.

I could see officers coming out of the van. They looked like the soldiers
in the bags that Mr. Santana sold in his store. I grabbed Kate and she held
me as we lay against the wall next to the window and waited.

There was the sound of breaking glass and smoke filled our room. Kate and I
rolled to the floor and tried not to choke on the fumes. We could hear
people shouting and running. The door to our room opened and there were
beams of light sweeping through the smoke. Hands grabbed us and lifted us
down the stairs and out of the house.

We stood now behind the lights and next to the police cars. Everyone seemed
to be there looking dazed and dirty but unharmed. Everyone, besides Wendy
and me, had their hands tied behind their backs including Dad and Michael.
They were all herded into a second police van. Wendy and I were placed in
the back of a police car.

After a few weeks in custody, no one was charged with any crime. Michael,
Wendy and I were sent to live with a foster family on the other side of the
city.  Dad moved to a small apartment near the factory where he continued
to work until it closed a few years latter and then went on to work at a
junk yard where he still works to this day removing working parts from cars
and appliances and grumbling about how people "ain't got no business owning
a dishwasher if they are just going to throw it out as soon as it gets
broke."
