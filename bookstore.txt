I would love to work at an anarchist bookstore. I would arrive late, read books all day ignoring customers and allow anyone who asked to take a book. When my "boss" confronted me, I would say, "Oh I am sorry. I thought this was an anarchist bookstore, not just another cog in the capitalist machine forever grinding away our souls into a fine slurry of spent grit and oil." and while he stood there dumbfounded in his own hypocrisy, you and your friend from New Hampshire would enter the store and we would smoke one last cigarette before tossing our still burning butts on the floor along with the remaining contents from whatever flasks we were carrying from last night's binge and just before making our escape to join the crowd gathered to watch the flames and feign helpless concern while secretly wishing the fire would engulf not just the store but burn on and on, threatening and then consuming the very fabric of their monotonous lives, leaving them standing there naked, cold and free.
