528 doesn't it?" he said.
529 
530 "So why do you do it?" asked Tom "It's a living. Well, not a very good
one.
531 It's all I know. I mean, do you all know why you do what you do?" No
one
532 answered.
533 
534 "Does anyone else know about your magic?" asked Tom. "I told a former
535 girlfriend once. I actually demonstrated it for her." Having finished
536 everything on his plate, he was now taking french fries from Seven's
plate.
537 "What happened?" "The next morning, before I even got up, she was gone.
538 Didn't even leave a pair of underwear." He looked down at his plate
shaking
539 his head "and No, I didn't make her disappear." He then looked back up
540 staring at them. "And now there is just you all."
541 
542 "So how about a place to stay?" he asked resting his elbows on the
table.
543 "I've been staying with a friend for the past two weeks, but he is

																													A
																													little
																													after

																													Adam
																													and
																													Clay
																													sat
																													across
																													a
																													marbled
																													Formica
																													table
																													in
																													a
																													 47
																													 tall
																													 backed
																													 and
																													 dimly
																													 lit
																													 booth.
																													 Stephanie,
																													 a
																													 woman
																													 who
																													 looked
																													 to
																													 be
																													 well
																													  48
																													  into
																													  her
																													  seventies
																													  approached
																													  to
																													  take
																													  their
																													  order.
																													  A
																													  small
																													  paper
																													  hat
																													  sat
																													   49
																													   neatly
																													   on
																													   a
																													   wavy
																													   pile
																													   of
																													   well
																													   coiffed
																													   white
																													   hair.
																													   She
																													   wore
																													   a
																													   light
																													   pink
																													    50
																														uniform
																														bordered
																														with
																														starched
																														white
																														collar
																														and
																														cuffs
																														and
																														a
																														pleated
																														white
																														 51
																														 apron
																														 tied
																														 about
																														 her
																														 waist.
																														 It
																														 was
																														 the
																														 same
																														 uniform
																														 she
																														 had
																														 worn
																														 for
																														 many
																														  52
																														  years
																														  and
																														  she
																														  still
																														  filled
																														  it
																														  well.
																														  But
																														  as
																														  she
																														  stood
																														  at
																														  their
																														  table
																														  she
																														   53
																														   stooped
																														   slightly,
																														   as
																														   if
																														   to
																														   suggest
																														   a
																														   change
																														   in
																														   trajectory.
																														    54 
																															 55
																															 She
																															 had
																															 worked

																															 the
																															 tavern
																															 since
																															 Adam
																															 and
																															 Clay
																															 were
																															 in
																															 their
																															 teens
																															 and
																															  56
																															  probably
																															  long
																															  before.
																															  Recognizing
																															  them
																															  she
																															  gave
																															  them
																															  a
																															  hearty
																															  "Hi
																															  fellas"
																															   57
																															   adding
																															   that
																															   she
																															   had
																															   not
																															   seen
																															   them
																															   for
																															   a
																															   couple
																															   of
																															   weeks.
																															   She
																															   took
																															   their
																															    58
																																orders
																																with
																																the
																																same
																																professional
																																competence
																																that
																																she
																																had
																																always
																																shown,
																																but
																																 59
																																 the
																																 rhythm
																																 of
																																 her
																																 performance
																																 was
																																 slightly
																																 stilted
																																 giving
																																 a
																																 sense
																																 that
																																 she
																																  60
																																  had
																																  begun
																																  relying
																																  more
																																  on
																																  patterns
																																  of
																																  habit
																																  than
																																  inspiration
																																  to
																																  get
																																  through
																																   61
																																   the
																																   day.
																																    62 
																																	 63
																																	 Adam
																																	 noticed
																																	 her
																																	 counterpart,
																																	 a
																																	 boy
																																	 still
																																	 in
																																	 college
																																	 and
																																	 doing
																																	 his
																																	 homework
																																	  64
																																	  at
																																	  the
																																	  bar
																																	  between
																																	  waiting
																																	  on
																																	  tables.
																																	  Behind
																																	  the
																																	  bar
																																	  was
																																	  Francis,
																																	  who
																																	  had
																																	   65
																																	   owned
																																	   the
																																	   tavern
																																	   for
																																	   the
																																	   past
																																	   fifteen
																																	   years
																																	   and
																																	   had
																																	   worked
																																	   there
																																	   for
																																	   ten
																																	    66
																																		years
																																		before
																																		that.
																																		Seeing
																																		Adam,
																																		he
																																		came
																																		out
																																		from
																																		behind
																																		the
																																		bar
																																		where
																																		he
																																		 67
																																		 still
																																		 worked
																																		 serving
																																		 drinks
																																		 seven
																																		 days
																																		 a
																																		 week.
																																		 As
																																		 he
																																		 approached
																																		 he
																																		 wiped
																																		  68
																																		  his
																																		  hands
																																		  on
																																		  an
																																		  apron
																																		  that
																																		  looked
																																		  dirty
																																		  enough
																																		  to
																																		  make
																																		  the
																																		  act
																																		  a
																																		  zero
																																		  sum
																																		   69
																																		   affair.
																																		   In
																																		   his
																																		   late
																																		   fifties,
																																		   he
																																		   combed
																																		   his
																																		   thin
																																		   hair
																																		   over
																																		   a
																																		   bald
																																		   pate.
																																		   He
																																		    70
																																			sat
																																			down
																																			heavily
																																			in
																																			the
																																			booth
																																			next
																																			to
																																			Clay
																																			and
																																			when
																																			asked
																																			how
																																			things
																																			were
																																			 71
																																			 going
																																			 gave
																																			 his
																																			 usual
																																			 answer
																																			 sighing
																																			 "Well,
																																			 I
																																			 seem
																																			 to
																																			 be
																																			 breaking
																																			 even."
																																			 But
																																			  72
																																			  there
																																			  was
																																			  nothing
																																			  in
																																			  his
																																			  manner
																																			  or
																																			  the
																																			  tavern
																																			  to
																																			  suggest
																																			  that
																																			  he
																																			  aspired
																																			  to
																																			   73
																																			   anything
																																			   more.
																																			    74 
																																				 75
																																				 "I
																																				 have
																																				 heard
																																				 a
																																				 rumor
																																				 that
																																				 Lawson
																																				 Properties
																																				 is
																																				 buying
																																				 the
																																				 building."
																																				 Adam
																																				  76
																																				  said.
																																				  "Yeah,
																																				  I
																																				  heard
																																				  that
																																				  as
																																				  well.
																																				  I
																																				  got
																																				  nothing
																																				  against
																																				  them.
																																				  Doesn't
																																				   77
																																				   matter
																																				   too
																																				   much
																																				   to
																																				   me
																																				   who
																																				   I
																																				   pay
																																				   the
																																				   rent
																																				   check
																																				   to."
																																				   "But
																																				   what
																																				   if
																																				   they
																																				   ask
																																				    78
																																					for
																																					more
																																					rent?"
																																					asked
																																					Clay.
																																					"How
																																					can
																																					they?"
																																					responded
																																					Francis.
																																					"There
																																					is
																																					no
																																					 79
																																					 way
																																					 I
																																					 can
																																					 afford
																																					 to
																																					 pay
																																					 any
																																					 more
																																					 than
																																					 I
																																					 do.
																																					 Like
																																					 trying
																																					 to
																																					 get
																																					 blood
																																					 from
																																					 a
																																					  80
																																					  stone."
																																					  He
																																					  laughed.
																																					  Francis
																																					  really
																																					  seemed
																																					  to
																																					  believe
																																					  in
																																					  his
																																					  logic
																																					  and
																																					  Adam
																																					   81
																																					   and
																																					   Clay
																																					   did
																																					   not
																																					   have
																																					   the
																																					   heart
																																					   to
																																					   enlighten
																																					   him.
																																					    82 
																																						 83
																																						 Francis
																																						 returned
																																						 to
																																						 the
																																						 bar.
																																						 Adam
																																						 stared
																																						 off
																																						 quietly
																																						 into
																																						 the
																																						 tavern
																																						  84
																																						  holding
																																						  a
																																						  martini
																																						  poised
																																						  above
																																						  the
																																						  table
																																						  in
																																						  his
																																						  heavy
																																						  almost
																																						  muscular
																																						   85
																																						   hands.
																																						   Hands
																																						   that
																																						   looked
																																						   like
																																						   they
																																						   had
																																						   been
																																						   forged
																																						   from
																																						   years
																																						   of
																																						   labor.
																																						   The
																																						    86
																																							sort
																																							of
																																							hands
																																							that
																																							Clay's
																																							own
																																							father
																																							had
																																							come
																																							by
																																							honestly,
																																							but
																																							here
																																							they
																																							 87
																																							 were
																																							 on
																																							 Adam
																																							 who
																																							 spent
																																							 his
																																							 days
																																							 typing
																																							 stories
																																							 for
																																							 a
																																							 local
																																							 magazine.
																																							 Clay
																																							  88
																																							  admired
																																							  them,
																																							  clean
																																							  and
																																							  manicured
																																							  and
																																							  tucked
																																							  gently
																																							  into
																																							  starched
																																							  white
																																							   89
																																							   cuffs
																																							   wrapped
																																							   in
																																							   fine
																																							   tweed
																																							   sleeves.
																																							   Clay's
																																							   own
																																							   hands
																																							   were
																																							   long
																																							   and
																																							   thin
																																							    90
																																								like
																																								his
																																								mother's.
																																								 91 
																																								  92
																																								  Leaving
																																								  the
																																								  tavern
																																								  they
																																								  walked
																																								  down
																																								  the
																																								  street
																																								  to
																																								  the
																																								  news
																																								  stand
																																								  on
																																								  the
																																								   93
																																								   corner.
																																								   Angelo,
																																								   the
																																								   owner,
																																								   stood
																																								   Adam
																																								   asked
																																								   if
																																								   he
																																								   had
																																								   heard
																																								   about
																																								   Layton's
																																								   plans
																																								    94
																																									for
																																									the
																																									Clark
																																									Building.
																																									Angelo
																																									said
																																									he
																																									had
																																									and
																																									figured
																																									his
																																									own
																																									days
																																									were
																																									 95
																																									 numbered
																																									 as
																																									 well.
																																									 "It
																																									 would
																																									 not
																																									 be
																																									 long
																																									 before
																																									 Layton
																																									 owned
																																									 every
																																									 building
																																									  96
																																									  in
																																									  the
																																									  square"
																																									  he
																																									  said
																																									  adding,
																																									  "It's
																																									  just
																																									  like
																																									  he
																																									  is
																																									  doing
																																									  with
																																									  Eastside."
																																									   97
																																									   Adam
																																									   and
																																									   Clay
																																									   had
																																									   both
																																									   heard
																																									   rumours
																																									   about
																																									   the
																																									   city's
																																									   plans
																																									   for
																																									   Eastside,
																																									    98
																																										an
																																										large
																																										section
																																										of
																																										the
																																										city
																																										area
																																										across
																																										the
																																										river.
																																										"I
																																										had
																																										heard
																																										the
																																										city
																																										 99
																																										 was
																																										 buying
																																										 properties
																																										 there."
																																										 said
																																										 Clay.
																																										 "Yes,
																																										 but
																																										 it
																																										 is
																																										 Layton
																																										 that
																																										 is
																																										 100
																																										 behind
																																										 the
																																										 whole
																																										 plan
																																										 and
																																										 the
																																										 city
																																										 is
																																										 not
																																										 buying
																																										 properties
																																										 it
																																										 is
																																										 101
																																										 condemning
																																										 them."
																																										 said
																																										 Angelo
																																										 "Once
																																										 they
																																										 condemn
																																										 a
																																										 property
																																										 all
																																										 of
																																										 the
																																										 rent
																																										 102
																																										 starts
																																										 going
																																										 to
																																										 the
																																										 city.
																																										 The
																																										 owner
																																										 becomes
																																										 desperate
																																										 to
																																										 sell
																																										 and
																																										 guess
																																										 who
																																										 103
																																										 picks
																																										 up
																																										 the

																																										 at

																																																																																		  46
																																																																																		  A
																																																																																		  little
																																																																																		  after
																																																																																		  noon,
																																																																																		  Adam
																																																																																		  and
																																																																																		  Clay
																																																																																		  sat
																																																																																		  across
																																																																																		  a
																																																																																		  marbled
																																																																																		  Formica
																																																																																		  table
																																																																																		  in
																																																																																		  a
																																																																																		   47
																																																																																		   tall
																																																																																		   backed
																																																																																		   and
																																																																																		   dimly
																																																																																		   lit
																																																																																		   booth.
																																																																																		   Stephanie,
																																																																																		   a
																																																																																		   woman
																																																																																		   who
																																																																																		   looked
																																																																																		   to
																																																																																		   be
																																																																																		   well
																																																																																		    48
																																																																																			into
																																																																																			her
																																																																																			seventies
																																																																																			approached
																																																																																			to
																																																																																			take
																																																																																			their
																																																																																			order.
																																																																																			A
																																																																																			small
																																																																																			paper
																																																																																			hat
																																																																																			sat
																																																																																			 49
																																																																																			 neatly
																																																																																			 on
																																																																																			 a
																																																																																			 wavy
																																																																																			 pile
																																																																																			 of
																																																																																			 well
																																																																																			 coiffed
																																																																																			 white
																																																																																			 hair.
																																																																																			 She
																																																																																			 wore
																																																																																			 a
																																																																																			 light
																																																																																			 pink
																																																																																			  50
																																																																																			  uniform
																																																																																			  bordered
																																																																																			  with
																																																																																			  starched
																																																																																			  white
																																																																																			  collar
																																																																																			  and
																																																																																			  cuffs
																																																																																			  and
																																																																																			  a
																																																																																			  pleated
																																																																																			  white
																																																																																			   51
																																																																																			   apron
																																																																																			   tied
																																																																																			   about
																																																																																			   her
																																																																																			   waist.
																																																																																			   It
																																																																																			   was
																																																																																			   the
																																																																																			   same
																																																																																			   uniform
																																																																																			   she
																																																																																			   had
																																																																																			   worn
																																																																																			   for
																																																																																			   many
																																																																																			    52
																																																																																				years
																																																																																				and
																																																																																				she
																																																																																				still
																																																																																				filled
																																																																																				it
																																																																																				well.
																																																																																				But
																																																																																				as
																																																																																				she
																																																																																				stood
																																																																																				at
																																																																																				their
																																																																																				table
																																																																																				she
																																																																																				 53
																																																																																				 stooped
																																																																																				 slightly,
																																																																																				 as
																																																																																				 if
																																																																																				 to
																																																																																				 suggest
																																																																																				 a
																																																																																				 change
																																																																																				 in
																																																																																				 trajectory.
																																																																																				  54 
																																																																																				   55
																																																																																				   She
																																																																																				   had
																																																																																				   worked
																																																																																				   at
																																																																																				   the
																																																																																				   tavern
																																																																																				   since
																																																																																				   Adam
																																																																																				   and
																																																																																				   Clay
																																																																																				   were
																																																																																				   in
																																																																																				   their
																																																																																				   teens
																																																																																				   and
																																																																																				    56
																																																																																					probably
																																																																																					long
																																																																																					before.
																																																																																					Recognizing
																																																																																					them
																																																																																					she
																																																																																					gave
																																																																																					them
																																																																																					a
																																																																																					hearty
																																																																																					"Hi
																																																																																					fellas"
																																																																																					 57
																																																																																					 adding
																																																																																					 that
																																																																																					 she
																																																																																					 had
																																																																																					 not
																																																																																					 seen
																																																																																					 them
																																																																																					 for
																																																																																					 a
																																																																																					 couple
																																																																																					 of
																																																																																					 weeks.
																																																																																					 She
																																																																																					 took
																																																																																					 their
																																																																																					  58
																																																																																					  orders
																																																																																					  with
																																																																																					  the
																																																																																					  same
																																																																																					  professional
																																																																																					  competence
																																																																																					  that
																																																																																					  she
																																																																																					  had
																																																																																					  always
																																																																																					  shown,
																																																																																					  but
																																																																																					   59
																																																																																					   the
																																																																																					   rhythm
																																																																																					   of
																																																																																					   her
																																																																																					   performance
																																																																																					   was
																																																																																					   slightly
																																																																																					   stilted
																																																																																					   giving
																																																																																					   a
																																																																																					   sense
																																																																																					   that
																																																																																					   she
																																																																																					    60
																																																																																						had
																																																																																						begun
																																																																																						relying
																																																																																						more
																																																																																						on
																																																																																						patterns
																																																																																						of
																																																																																						habit
																																																																																						than
																																																																																						inspiration
																																																																																						to
																																																																																						get
																																																																																						through
																																																																																						 61
																																																																																						 the
																																																																																						 day.
																																																																																						  62 
																																																																																						   63
																																																																																						   Adam
																																																																																						   noticed
																																																																																						   her
																																																																																						   counterpart,
																																																																																						   a
																																																																																						   boy
																																																																																						   still
																																																																																						   in
																																																																																						   college
																																																																																						   and
																																																																																						   doing
																																																																																						   his
																																																																																						   homework
																																																																																						    64
																																																																																							at
																																																																																							the
																																																																																							bar
																																																																																							between
																																																																																							waiting
																																																																																							on
																																																																																							tables.
																																																																																							Behind
																																																																																							the
																																																																																							bar
																																																																																							was
																																																																																							Francis,
																																																																																							who
																																																																																							had
																																																																																							 65
																																																																																							 owned
																																																																																							 the
																																																																																							 tavern
																																																																																							 for
																																																																																							 the
																																																																																							 past
																																																																																							 fifteen
																																																																																							 years
																																																																																							 and
																																																																																							 had
																																																																																							 worked
																																																																																							 there
																																																																																							 for
																																																																																							 ten
																																																																																							  66
																																																																																							  years
																																																																																							  before
																																																																																							  that.
																																																																																							  Seeing
																																																																																							  Adam,
																																																																																							  he
																																																																																							  came
																																																																																							  out
																																																																																							  from
																																																																																							  behind
																																																																																							  the
																																																																																							  bar
																																																																																							  where
																																																																																							  he
																																																																																							   67
																																																																																							   still
																																																																																							   worked
																																																																																							   serving
																																																																																							   drinks
																																																																																							   seven
																																																																																							   days
																																																																																							   a
																																																																																							   week.
																																																																																							   As
																																																																																							   he
																																																																																							   approached
																																																																																							   he
																																																																																							   wiped
																																																																																							    68
																																																																																								his
																																																																																								hands
																																																																																								on
																																																																																								an
																																																																																								apron
																																																																																								that
																																																																																								looked
																																																																																								dirty
																																																																																								enough
																																																																																								to
																																																																																								make
																																																																																								the
																																																																																								act
																																																																																								a
																																																																																								zero
																																																																																								sum
																																																																																								 69
																																																																																								 affair.
																																																																																								 In
																																																																																								 his
																																																																																								 late
																																																																																								 fifties,
																																																																																								 he
																																																																																								 combed
																																																																																								 his
																																																																																								 thin
																																																																																								 hair
																																																																																								 over
																																																																																								 a
																																																																																								 bald
																																																																																								 pate.
																																																																																								 He
																																																																																								  70
																																																																																								  sat
																																																																																								  down
																																																																																								  heavily
																																																																																								  in
																																																																																								  the
																																																																																								  booth
																																																																																								  next
																																																																																								  to
																																																																																								  Clay
																																																																																								  and
																																																																																								  when
																																																																																								  asked
																																																																																								  how
																																																																																								  things
																																																																																								  were
																																																																																								   71
																																																																																								   going
																																																																																								   gave
																																																																																								   his
																																																																																								   usual
																																																																																								   answer
																																																																																								   sighing
																																																																																								   "Well,
																																																																																								   I
																																																																																								   seem
																																																																																								   to
																																																																																								   be
																																																																																								   breaking
																																																																																								   even."
																																																																																								   But
																																																																																								    72
																																																																																									there
																																																																																									was
																																																																																									nothing
																																																																																									in
																																																																																									his
																																																																																									manner
																																																																																									or
																																																																																									the
																																																																																									tavern
																																																																																									to
																																																																																									suggest
																																																																																									that
																																																																																									he
																																																																																									aspired
																																																																																									to
																																																																																									 73
																																																																																									 anything
																																																																																									 more.
																																																																																									  74 
																																																																																									   75
																																																																																									   "I
																																																																																									   have
																																																																																									   heard
																																																																																									   a
																																																																																									   rumor
																																																																																									   that
																																																																																									   Lawson
																																																																																									   Properties
																																																																																									   is
																																																																																									   buying
																																																																																									   the
																																																																																									   building."
																																																																																									   Adam
																																																																																									    76
																																																																																										said.
																																																																																										"Yeah,
																																																																																										I
																																																																																										heard
																																																																																										that
																																																																																										as
																																																																																										well.
																																																																																										I
																																																																																										got
																																																																																										nothing
																																																																																										against
																																																																																										them.
																																																																																										Doesn't
																																																																																										 77
																																																																																										 matter
																																																																																										 too
																																																																																										 much
																																																																																										 to
																																																																																										 me
																																																																																										 who
																																																																																										 I
																																																																																										 pay
																																																																																										 the
																																																																																										 rent
																																																																																										 check
																																																																																										 to."
																																																																																										 "But
																																																																																										 what
																																																																																										 if
																																																																																										 they
																																																																																										 ask
																																																																																										  78
																																																																																										  for
																																																																																										  more
																																																																																										  rent?"
																																																																																										  asked
																																																																																										  Clay.
																																																																																										  "How
																																																																																										  can
																																																																																										  they?"
																																																																																										  responded
																																																																																										  Francis.
																																																																																										  "There
																																																																																										  is
																																																																																										  no
																																																																																										   79
																																																																																										   way
																																																																																										   I
																																																																																										   can
																																																																																										   afford
																																																																																										   to
																																																																																										   pay
																																																																																										   any
																																																																																										   more
																																																																																										   than
																																																																																										   I
																																																																																										   do.
																																																																																										   Like
																																																																																										   trying
																																																																																										   to
																																																																																										   get
																																																																																										   blood
																																																																																										   from
																																																																																										   a
																																																																																										    80
																																																																																											stone."
																																																																																											He
																																																																																											laughed.
																																																																																											Francis
																																																																																											really
																																																																																											seemed
																																																																																											to
																																																																																											believe
																																																																																											in
																																																																																											his
																																																																																											logic
																																																																																											and
																																																																																											Adam
																																																																																											 81
																																																																																											 and
																																																																																											 Clay
																																																																																											 did
																																																																																											 not
																																																																																											 have
																																																																																											 the
																																																																																											 heart
																																																																																											 to
																																																																																											 enlighten
																																																																																											 him.
																																																																																											  82 
																																																																																											   83
																																																																																											   Francis
																																																																																											   returned
																																																																																											   to
																																																																																											   the
																																																																																											   bar.
																																																																																											   Adam
																																																																																											   stared
																																																																																											   off
																																																																																											   quietly
																																																																																											   into
																																																																																											   the
																																																																																											   tavern
																																																																																											    84
																																																																																												holding
																																																																																												a
																																																																																												martini
																																																																																												poised
																																																																																												above
																																																																																												the
																																																																																												table
																																																																																												in
																																																																																												his
																																																																																												heavy
																																																																																												almost
																																																																																												muscular
																																																																																												 85
																																																																																												 hands.
																																																																																												 Hands
																																																																																												 that
																																																																																												 looked
																																																																																												 like
																																																																																												 they
																																																																																												 had
																																																																																												 been
																																																																																												 forged
																																																																																												 from
																																																																																												 years
																																																																																												 of
																																																																																												 labor.
																																																																																												 The
																																																																																												  86
																																																																																												  sort
																																																																																												  of
																																																																																												  hands
																																																																																												  that
																																																																																												  Clay's
																																																																																												  own
																																																																																												  father
																																																																																												  had
																																																																																												  come
																																																																																												  by
																																																																																												  honestly,
																																																																																												  but
																																																																																												  here
																																																																																												  they
																																																																																												   87
																																																																																												   were
																																																																																												   on
																																																																																												   Adam
																																																																																												   who
																																																																																												   spent
																																																																																												   his
																																																																																												   days
																																																																																												   typing
																																																																																												   stories
																																																																																												   for
																																																																																												   a
																																																																																												   local
																																																																																												   magazine.
																																																																																												   Clay
																																																																																												    88
																																																																																													admired
																																																																																													them,
																																																																																													clean
																																																																																													and
																																																																																													manicured
																																																																																													and
																																																																																													tucked
																																																																																													gently
																																																																																													into
																																																																																													starched
																																																																																													white
																																																																																													 89
																																																																																													 cuffs
																																																																																													 wrapped
																																																																																													 in
																																																																																													 fine
																																																																																													 tweed
																																																																																													 sleeves.
																																																																																													 Clay's
																																																																																													 own
																																																																																													 hands
																																																																																													 were
																																																																																													 long
																																																																																													 and
																																																																																													 thin
																																																																																													  90
																																																																																													  like
																																																																																													  his
																																																																																													  mother's.
																																																																																													   91 
																																																																																													    92
																																																																																														Leaving
																																																																																														the
																																																																																														tavern
																																																																																														they
																																																																																														walked
																																																																																														down
																																																																																														the
																																																																																														street
																																																																																														to
																																																																																														the
																																																																																														news
																																																																																														stand
																																																																																														on
																																																																																														the
																																																																																														 93
																																																																																														 corner.
																																																																																														 Angelo,
																																																																																														 the
																																																																																														 owner,
																																																																																														 stood
																																																																																														 Adam
																																																																																														 asked
																																																																																														 if
																																																																																														 he
																																																																																														 had
																																																																																														 heard
																																																																																														 about
																																																																																														 Layton's
																																																																																														 plans
																																																																																														  94
																																																																																														  for
																																																																																														  the
																																																																																														  Clark
																																																																																														  Building.
																																																																																														  Angelo
																																																																																														  said
																																																																																														  he
																																																																																														  had
																																																																																														  and
																																																																																														  figured
																																																																																														  his
																																																																																														  own
																																																																																														  days
																																																																																														  were
																																																																																														   95
																																																																																														   numbered
																																																																																														   as
																																																																																														   well.
																																																																																														   "It
																																																																																														   would
																																																																																														   not
																																																																																														   be
																																																																																														   long
																																																																																														   before
																																																																																														   Layton
																																																																																														   owned
																																																																																														   every
																																																																																														   building
																																																																																														    96
																																																																																															in

																																																																																															he
																																																																																															said

																																																																																															"It's
																																																																																															just
																																																																																															like
																																																																																															he
																																																																																															is
																																																																																															doing
																																																																																															with
																																																																																															Eastside."
																																																																																															 97
																																																																																															 Adam
																																																																																															 and

																																																																																															 had

																																																																																															 heard
																																																																																															 rumours
																																																																																															 about

																																																																																																						  I

																																																																																																						   said
																																																																																																						   Clay
																																																																																																						   through
																																																																																																						   the
																																																																																																						   steam
																																																																																																						   rising
																																																																																																						   off
																																																																																																						   his

																																																																																																						   "I

																																																																																																							Adam
																																																																																																							reached
																																																																																																							down
																																																																																																							to
																																																																																																							massage
																																																																																																							his

																																																																																																							Clay
																																																																																																							looked

																																																																																																							 the

																																																																																																							   "Are

																																																																																																							   "I

																																																																																																							    25
																																																																																																								Clay
																																																																																																								eyed
																																																																																																								a
																																																																																																								bottle
																																																																																																								of
																																																																																																								vodka
																																																																																																								that

																																																																																																								left
																																																																																																								on

																																																																																																								 the

																																																																																																								 "We
