As we sat in the shade of the willow tree, Dad pointed out the different
types of boats on the river. None of the boats were very big. They were
mostly sail boats and mostly used as trainers by the local colleges, but
Dad described each one as seriously as if it where an ocean going vessel.
He told us which ones were fast and why, which ones could carry the most
cargo and how many crew they each needed.

As he spoke, we paid close attention. Dad was still Dad, even for Michael
my older brother who was almost 16. Dad's taught muscled arms seemed as
strong as steel and six foot frame seemed as tall as tall could be.

As he gathered us into a circle to describe his plan, I could sense
that something dangerous was about to happen and that there was no way
I could avoid it. Michael and Wendy never seemed scared. It was as if
they and Dad were made of the same material, but I was different. I
sometimes felt like I wasn't supposed to be there, but there was no
where else to go. 

The plan was to capture one of the sail boats, in particular one of
the 21-foot Sonars which Dad described as the most worthy boat on the
river. The only question was how to launch our attack. 

Not far to our left was a sandy spot where a few people were putting their
kayaks into the river. Dad decided that we should wait until one of the
two-person kayaks was left temporarily unattended and then quickly and
quietly commandeer it for our own.

When the moment came, Dad signaled to us move. By the time we reached the
sand we were running full speed. As arranged, I jumped on front and lay
low.  Michael took the front seat and Dad took the back. Wendy pushed hard
from the shore and leapt onto the rear of the boat and then lay low as well.
We were quickly underway with Dad and Michael paddling hard. 
   
The other people on the launch area seemed startled by our actions, but
made no attempt to stop us. By the time the couple noticed we had taken
their kayak, we were far out on the river. I could hear their shouts and
glanced back to see them waving their arms in a way that seemed indicate
they felt there must be some misunderstanding.

I could also see the intent faces of Wendy, Michael and Dad who were
looking past me and focused on a single sail boat that Dad had pointed out
as our target. The boat was coming toward us and moving fast in the strong
wind. It was tacking at a slight angle to our course cutting from right to
left across our bow.  The two college students piloting the boat tried to
make adjustments to their course in order to avoid us, but we countered
each of their moves.

As the students began to notice the seriousness of the situation, they
started to wave us off in an attempt to avoid a collision, but Micheal and
Dad just dug in harder making their intention clear to even the most naive
observer.

By this point, Wendy had moved forward of Dad and we were all three
standing. Wendy and Micheal both barefoot with pants rolled up past their
ankles. Wendy with dark streaks of mud she had managed to smear on her face
and Michael with his T-shirt tied roughly about his head.  

A moment before collision, we jumped to their boat with feral screams and
teeth bared. The students dropped their lines and rudder and stood staring
as Wendy and Michael rushed toward them. They both put out their hands in a
half-hearted attempt to defend themselves, but their soft cafeteria-fed
bodies were no match for our sharp hungry frames wielding paddles and
savagery. Wendy and Michael slowly marched them backwards right off the
boat and into the water. They bobbed in their life jackets and in the wake
of the commotion and tried to make their way clear of the boat.

Dad grabbed the rudder and shouted commands. Wendy held the main sheet and

zoo closed and. The plan was to remain in sight of the snack hut and enter
in ones and twos when no one was looking. It was a weekday so the zoo would
not be that busy. Dad had noted that the back door to the hut remained
opened. 

Once inside we were to commander a large backhoe that was near a
construction area. Dad said these were easy to start and they often left
the keys in the ignition. The plan was to run a cable from the tractor to
the bars of the cage. The cable would be used to pull down the bars of the
cage. Once we had freed the gorillas we would move on to the other pens.
Dad had marked this all on his map. Indicating where we would be at any
point in time. He had made estimates for how long each would take.


No sooner does the screen pop into her hand than some nacent idea journey
forth, still wet from birth, with a no more instinct than that necessary
for blinking and breathing, comes forth screaming and shouting and dying. 

We stood watching a girls soccer game. We had been on our way to the store
and I am not sure why we stopped.  It was just one of those moments were we
all seemed to have the same thought at once. The girls on our side of the
field were from the local high school. We didn't say anything. Dad seemed
to be studing the game very carefully. The local team appeared to be
losing. 

Dad then turned to us and said, the problem is that they are not using
their hands. You see, each team is trying to move the ball into the other
team's goals, but if they just used their hands it would be so much easier.
Suddenly the game appeared as silly as a sack race with girls awkwardly
trying to 

Just as the ball came close to where we were standing, Dad ran onto the
field grabbed the ball with his hands and then started running toward the
opposing team's goal. Both referres were blowing their whistles and moving
toward him. The girls just stopped playing and stood staring at Dad as he
ran past them making his way to the goal.  As he flung the ball in the
goal, Michael and Wendy let out huge cheers and I joined in with them.  

Every little trival thought that enters one's head is immediately sent out
into the universe, ideas barely formed. The cost of transmission too easy.
The barrier too low. No need or time to sit with a thought and work it out.
No time to think at all. The cost of transmission so small that the merest
thought could be flung into the universe. Television as insidious as it
was, was at least created with some effort. Some work went into creating
the scripts. Some thought went into working with the actors, albeit for the
masses. But we had traded one medium curated for the masses with another
currated by the masses with no great improvement. No need for sustained
thought. No time for ideas to be born and die before reaching maturity. No
time for maturity at all. Sustained thinking was no longer necessary or
even possible. 

I don't recall any close friends from school. I do recall that most of them
had mothers and fathers and some talked about aunts and uncles and
grandparents. These were not familiar to me. 

Every part of a mechanical device is designed to work in coordination. The

their own vibrations.  Each motion transfers its motion to the next. Each

mechanical parts meet there is vibration. But man can't design a perfect
