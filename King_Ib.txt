To say that King Ib was a man of habit would be an understatement. Every
morning he rose at six and ate breakfast at seven. His lunch was served at
noon with dinner following at five. By eight o'clock, he was in bed and
fast sleep.  Only his dinner menu varied by the day of the week with fish
on Monday, mutton on Tuesday and so on.

All of his habits including his meetings with ministers, walks in the
garden and formal banquets were arranged to punctuate his days, weeks and
months at regular intervals. It was not only the king's habits, but the
habits of his entire kingdom that commenced in a mechanically predictable
pattern. At three o'clock each day you could expect to see the baker
passing the florist on his way to deliver a dozen pasteries to the castle,
and the florist inside his shop preparing bouquets for the evenings meal.

But the king, and so the kingdom, had not always been this way. King Ib was
the only child of King Et and Queen An and they were always very good to
their little prince. Some might argue, too good. It was their desire that
their son's desires never go unmet. He ate what he liked and had meals when
he wanted. He had ponies and playmates and even won games when he wished.
Instead of surprising the prince on his birthdays, the king and queen
simply asked him what he wanted and made sure he got it. 

The prince was always happy as long as he got what he wanted, and he
always got what he wanted, so he was always happy.

It came to pass that the king and queen both died, but the kingdom had
become accustomed to granting the now young king's wishes and so the habit
continued.

Then one afternoon young king Ib, while riding in his coach, spied a maiden
gathering flowers in a park. He had never seen her before, so knew that she
must be new to the kingdom. As he approached, she rose and wiped her brow
and stood gazing straight past him and into her own thoughts.

As he watched her standing there, a desire stirred in him more powerful than he
had ever felt before. Without exchanging a single word, he decided that she
should be his queen and asked his ministers to make arrangements for his
marriage. Immediately a date was set and work begun to prepare for a royal
wedding. A young and trusted minister named Or was dispatched to find the young
maiden and inform her of the news. 

When Or found her, she was living alone in a small cottage on the edge of the
kingdom. He informed her of the wedding, and as he began to describe her
role as the future queen something happened that had never happened before.
She said "No."  He continued with his description barely acknowledging her
answer because it was to a question that he had not even asked. When
finally the minister realized something was wrong he stopped.  He stood
looking at her without knowing what to say.

Given that there seemed to be some confusion. The young maiden clarified her
feelings, saying, "I have no intention of marrying the king" Young Or opened
his mouth, but all that came out was "Ahh" and then when he had slightly
recovered "Yes...I will inform the king." The minister returned to the castle
fearing for his job if not for his very life and told the king his story.

The king listened to Or and did not say a word. He felt the painful sense of
desire that results from not getting what one deeply desires, and then he felt
fear. Suddenly, his world had stopped behaving in a way that it had always
behaved before. It was as if one day, the sun had one day simply decided not to
rise.

When Or finished his story, the king slowly got up from his chair and walked
into his chamber. He climbed into the royal bed and pulled the royal covers
over his royal head. 

Each of his ministers tried to appease him by bringing him things he had
desired in the past, but what he wanted was what he wanted, not what he had
wanted and the only thing he wanted was to marry the girl he saw in the park.

Finally Ut, his oldest and wised minister, was called in to help. "Ut, what
should I do", the king moaned from beneath the sheets. You should order her to
marry you, replied Ut. The king was silent for a moment and then peaked out at
Ut. "Order her to marry me? Yes, yes, of course" the king said. "And how should
we go about doing that?" he asked. For the king had never ordered anyone to do
anything before. Ut said that he would take care of the matter and sent two of
the kings guards off to the maiden's house.

After being shown in, the guards read the royal decree ordering the maiden
to marry the king. The maiden looked up from her mending and said, "I am
sorry, but I won't." Not knowing what else to do, the guards returned to the
castle and relayed their news.

Minister Ut's voice betrayed some concern when he told the king the news, but
immediately suggested a new strategy. The king should force the maiden to marry
him. "Yes, yes, we must use force" the king responded but did not bother to ask
Ut about how to go about this, for the king had never forced anyone to do
anything before.

Again, the guards were dispatched to the maiden's house though this time armed
with swords. Entering the house, they brandished their swords and demanded that
the maiden marry the king. The maiden looked up from her washing and said, "No".
Having no idea what to do next, the guards returned to the castle.

Ut now began to worry. It seemed they were dealing with more powerful creature
than he had first suspected. He began to fear for the king's life. He tried to
convince the king that maybe he should reconsider his desire to marry the
maiden and even suggested that his own niece had always been very fond of the
king.

The king went to bed that night feeling even worse than before. His dreams
knocked him about all night and finally tossed him awake in the wee hours of
the next morning. He immediately summoned his guards to take him to the
maiden's house.

Entering the maiden's house, looking disheveled and exhausted, and without
regard for the usual formalities of conversation he said to the maiden,
"Why won't you marry me?". 

The maiden looked up at the king and said, "Because I don't want to marry
you." and then to fill the silence, "I generally only do things that I want
to do." "So do I!" exclaimed the king, excited that they had found some
common ground. "But that is just the problem" said the maiden.  "Our
desires are incompatible." "Incompatible" said the King quietly to himself
liking the sound of the word but not its meaning.  

"But how can this be possible?" exclaimed the king. "Everything is
possible." said the maiden. "But it has never happened before." said the
king. "That is true of lots of things" she said. He eyed her warily. 

And then with no warning to himself or anyone else, he threw himself into a
king-sized tantrum complete with kicking and screaming and crying and after
finally exhausting himself and falling into a unkingly-like ball on the
floor, he peaked out with one eye to see if his performance had had its
desired effect. 

Looking non-plussed, the maiden suggested, "Maybe your whole premise is
wrong." "My what?" said the king addressing her from the floor. "Your way
of going about things, always just getting what you want." "But it has
always worked" he complained.  "Until now." she said. 

The king lay on the floor staring at a small crack in the ceiling and
thinking it looked like a rabbit. And then in an uncharacteristically sober
tone said, "Well I don't know what else to do." 

"Well what do you want to do?" asked the maiden. "Isn't that just the
problem" said the king soberly. For a while the king just lay silently
staring at the ceiling until he drifted into sleep because there seemed to
be nothing else left to do.

The maiden went out to fetch a rabbit for her evening stew and came back to
find the king still on her floor, a bejeweled lump of velvet and fur, his
head and limbs splayed to no advantage, his mouth agape and emitting a
faint whistle with every breath. What had been mildly amusing was now
irksome, vulgar and more importantly in the way of her path to the
cupboard.

She woke him with a splash of cold water and guided him to a cart she had
hitched to her horse. The king sat quietly all the way to the castle where
she dumped him at the gate and returned home.

Finding the king at the gate, the guards carried him into the castle and
immediately put his exhausted body to bed. 

Waking the next morning, the ministers found the king much refreshed. With
great relief they walked him to his throne where he sat and adjusted
himself as if sitting in a new chair for the first time. After a few
minutes the king spoke. "Well, what shall we do?" No one was sure how to
answer until Ut finally said, "I suggest we put the past few weeks behind
us and return to our...hmm, normal routines." Everyone nodded and the king
said, "Yes, yes, I quite agree. Let us get back to our normal routines."

And so the ministers waited while the king sat. As the waiting became
awkward, the king looked around and said, "Well what do you want me to do?"
Minister Or finally spoke up and said, "Well sire, we were waiting for you
to express a desire."  "Oh, right" said the king as if this had been
obvious to him as well.

And then everyone waited some more. The king furrowed his brow, rubbed his
chin, pursed his lips and generally expressed all the expressions of a
person working hard in thought. But try as he might, desire escaped him. No
matter how much he furrowed or rubbed or pursed he simply could not think
of anything he wanted. After several days had passed, he began to wonder
where had all his desires gone? Had he simply used them all up. No one
seemed to know. 

Minister Ub, who everyone thought thought too much, suggested that the king
was having trouble coming up with a desire precisely because he was trying
too hard to come up with a desire. This made no sense to anyone else, but
they were all willing to give it try, if only to avoid having Ub launch
into another long winded explanation of his theory.

For a few days, no one mentioned desires at all, and neither did the king.

Their efforts continued until it became apparent that the only desire left
in the castle was for the king to have a desire. None of the ministers knew
what to do.

Meanwhile in the kingdom, the villagers had not heard from their king in
weeks. At first, there was some relief from the usual frenzy of the king's 
whims and wishes, but slowly relief turned to restlessness. 

"What should we do?" said the shoemaker to the blacksmith who happened to
be walking by his shop one day. "Do whatever you want?" the blacksmith
responded, doing his best to convey a sense of feeling carefree.  "Look at
me." he went on to explain, "I am taking a walk." as if to further make his
point. The shoemaker looked at the blacksmith and thought it a very poor
example.  "What is the point of taking a walk?" he asked. "Does there need
to be a point?" responded the blacksmith slightly disheartened that his
performance and not been more well received. "Well, it certainly helps."
suggested the shoemaker.  "Oh hum" said the blacksmith and continued on his
walk.

But not all hands remained idle. The wainwright was profiting handsomely
from a boom cart repairs for which the demand was so high that he had
doubled his prices. This lasted until the barber confronted the wainwright
claiming that the inordinate number of broken carts was no fluke, but the
result of sabotage. The wainwright vehemently denied any such claim, but
the barber said, "Why I caught your very son loosening the cotter-pin on my
very cart!" This accusation being far too serious to be countered with
words the two came to blows.

Hearing the commotion the, baker came out to defend the barber and then the
butcher came out to defend the wainwright and one by one the entire village
spilled into the street taking one side or the other in the conflict.

The battle raged until one side, no one remembers which, took the
advantage. Seeing the battle lost the other side fled for the safety of the
castle with their aggressors in close pursuit.  

Easily overwhelming the castle guards, one of whom was strongly considering
a different line of work after the trials of the past few weeks, the rout
continued all the way up to the royal hall where entire village mob came to
an abrupt halt. At the end of the hall sat their king listing on the throne
like a ship run aground. Quietly the villagers pushed forward until they
filled the hall.

"What is wrong with the king?" asked a voice from the crowd. "We don't
know." responded one of the ministers. "Is he sick?" "The royal doctor can
find nothing wrong." "Does he just sit there?" "Yes, mostly." "Doesn't he
want anything?" "That is just the problem. There is nothing he seems to
want." "No pies?" asked the baker. "No parties?" suggested the dressmaker.
The ministers just shook their heads.

"Have you suggested shovelboard?" said one of the villagers, for it was
well known that the king loved shovelboard. "Yes, of course." said a
minister "and we tried a dozen other games as well." which he went on to
list. "Have you tried not mentioning..." "Yes, yes, not mentioning any
desires at all." the minister Ut groaned, "It didn't help." 

For a while everyone was silent while they looked at the king searching for
some sign of desire lurking behind his sullen mask.

Then the baker, said quite loudly and confidently, "The king wants
to host a party this weekend and he wants me to make his favorite cake."
Everyone looked at the baker as if he had gone quite mad.  But the baker
looked back at everyone as if he had gone anything but mad.  Then the
florist catching the bakers lead said, "Yes, and he demands a bouquet of
flowers at every table."  "And he requests a new cape?" the tailor
suggested cautiously, looking at the baker and florist for encouragement.

The butcher then said, "The king would like sausage." "...and eggs" added
the farmer and then with slightly more gusto "for breakfast every weekday
morning at 8am." he shouted. There were cries of "here, here" from the
villagers. 

"And toast." said a quiet voice. Everyone stopped and stared because the
quiet voice came from the king. "And I should like to meet with my
ministers every Friday." the king added with slightly more confidence. And
as a smile slowly appeared on the king's face, the villagers shouted
"Hooray!" 

The crowd broke into a frenzy of suggestions for this or that happening at
this or that time until the sound of suggestions sounded like nothing more
than the gaggle of geese. Finally Minister Ut was able to quiet the crowd.
He called the royal scribe forward and said, "Now then, let's begin with
Monday morning."

It was not until the wee hours of the following day that they reached
Sunday evening. By that time every minute of every day had been accounted
for along with the lives of every member of the royal kingdom. And from
that day forward the king and the kingdom lived happily ever after.

"But what happened to the maiden?" She looked up at her father. "Oh she is
sitting in her cabin by the fire." his voice carried her there. and she
looked over at the tiny cabin with the glow of orange light inside as night
came over the village. "She is much happier without that pesky king
bothering her." he looked down at her and smiled. 

She looked around at the other other boys and girls peering over at the
finely crafted village. Their eyes darted about quickly, arms stretched
over the railing pointing this way and that, and shouting, and then running
off to be replaced by another. Two boys began to tug at each other as they
held the railing escalating until their mother came and pulled them apart.
before one could swing a punch.

She watched as a tiny carriage moved on its track into a tiny carriage
house for the night and dim lights began to appear all over the village.

made way through the department store.  Around her mothers and fathers and
children all dressed in bright reds and shiny black women in bright red
coats with fine black trim. Carrying packages all wrapped in green and red
with colorful bows. Bundles. An employee pushed a large cart with boxes so
high a family beside. The two girls tugging at their fathers coat. Dressed
in bright red.

She felt her own sleeve frayed. 

A boy sat crying. His mother pleading with him to go home. 

As they made their way out of the department store she could see snow
falling by the window. Her hand warm in his she never wanted to let go.
