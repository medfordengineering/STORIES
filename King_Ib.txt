The Story of King Ib 

To say that King Ib was a man of habit would be an understatement. Every
morning he rose at six and ate breakfast at seven. Lunch was served at noon
with dinner following at five. By eight o'clock, he was in bed and fast sleep.
Only his dinner menu varied by the day of the week with fish on Monday, mutton
on Tuesday and so on.

All of his habits including his meetings with ministers, walks in the
garden and formal banquets were arranged to punctuate his days, weeks and
months at regular intervals. It was not only the king's habits, but the
habits of his entire kingdom that commenced in a mechanically predictable
pattern. At one o'clock each day you could expect to see the baker passing
the florist on his way to deliver a dozen pasteries to the castle, and the
florist inside his shop preparing bouquets for the evenings meal.

Even the heavens conformed to the unusual nature of the kingdom with the sun
crossing the horizon at exactly six each morning and passing below exactly 12
hours later. Rain fell on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons with partly cloudy
skies during the reminder of the week.

But the king, and so the kingdom, had not always been this way. King Ib was
the only child of King Et and Queen An and they were always very good to
their little prince. Some might argue, too good. It was their desire that
their son's desires never go unmet. He ate what he liked and had meals when
he wanted. He had ponies and playmates and even won games when he wished.
Instead of surprising the prince on his birthdays, the king and queen
simply asked him what he wanted and made sure he got it. 

The prince was always happy as long as he got what he wanted, and he
always got what he wanted, so he was always happy.

It came to pass that the king and queen both died, but the kingdom had
become accustomed to granting the now young king's wishes and so the habit
continued.

Then one afternoon young king Ib, while riding in his coach, spied a maiden
gathering flowers in the park. He had never seen her before, so knew that
she must be new to the kingdom. As he approached, she rose and wiped her
brow. She stood gazing past him and into her own thoughts.

As he watched her standing there, a desire stirred in him more powerful than he
had ever felt before. Without exchanging a single word, he decided that she
should be his queen and asked his ministers to make arrangements for his
marriage. Immediately a date was set and work begun to prepare for a royal
wedding. A young and trusted minister named Or was dispatched to find the young
maiden and inform her of the news. 

When Or found her, she was living alone in a small cabin on the edge of the
kingdom. He informed her of the wedding, and as he began to describe her
role as the future queen something happened that had never happened before.
She said "no."  He continued with his description barely acknowledging her
answer because it was to a question that he had not even asked. When
finally the minister realized something was wrong he stopped.  He stood
looking at her without knowing what to say.

Given that there seemed to be some confusion. The young maiden clarified her
feelings, saying, "I have no intention of marrying the king" Young Or opened
his mouth, but all that came out was "Ahh" and then when he had slightly
recovered "Yes...I will inform the king." The minister returned to the castle
fearing for his job if not for his very life and told the king his story.

The king listened to Or and did not say a word. He felt the painful sense of
desire that results from not getting what one deeply desires, and then he felt
fear. Suddenly, his world had stopped behaving in a way that it had always
behaved before. It was as if one day, the sun had one day simply decided not to
rise.

When Or finished his story, the king slowly got up from his chair and walked
into his chamber. He climbed into the royal bed and pulled the royal covers
over his royal head. 

Each of his ministers tried to appease him by bringing him things he had
desired in the past, but what he wanted was what he wanted, not what he had
wanted and the only thing he wanted was to marry the girl he saw in the park.

Finally Ut, his oldest and wised minister, was called in to help. "Ut, what
should I do", the king moaned from beneath the sheets. You should order her to
marry you, replied Ut. The king was silent for a moment and then peaked out at
Ut. "Order her to marry me? Yes, yes, of course" the king said. "And how should
we go about doing that?" he asked. For the king had never ordered anyone to do
anything before. Ut said that he would take care of the matter and sent two of
the kings guards off to the maiden's house.

After being shown in, the guards read the royal decree ordering the maiden
to marry the king. The maiden looked up from her mending and said, "I am
sorry, but I won't." Not knowing what else to do, the guards returned to the
castle and relayed their news.

Minister Ut's voice betrayed some concern when he told the king the news, but
immediately suggested a new strategy. The king should force the maiden to marry
him. "Yes, yes, we must use force" the king responded but did not bother to ask
Ut about how to go about this, for the king had never forced anyone to do
anything before.

Again, the guards were dispatched to the maiden's house though this time armed
with swords. Entering the house, they brandished their swords and demanded that
the maiden marry the king. The maiden looked up from her washing and said, "No".
Having no idea what to do next, the guards returned to the castle.

Ut now began to worry. It seemed they were dealing with more powerful creature
than he had first suspected. He began to fear for the king's life. He tried to
convince the king that maybe he should reconsider his desire to marry the
maiden and even suggested that his own niece had always been very fond of the
king.

The king went to bed that night feeling even worse than before. His dreams
knocked him about all night and finally tossed him awake in the wee hours of
the next morning. He immediately summoned his guards to take him to the
maiden's house.

Entering the maiden's house, looking disheveled and exhausted, and without
regard for the usual formalities of conversation he said to the maiden,
"Why won't you marry me?". 

The maiden looked up at the king and said, "Because I don't want to marry
you." and then to fill the silence, "I generally only do things that I want
to do." "So do I" exclaimed the king, excited that they had found some
common ground. "But that is just the problem" said the maiden.  "Our
desires are incompatible." "Incompatible" said the King quietly to himself
liking the sound of the word but not its meaning.  

"But why should you get what you want?" asked the king.  "It's not fair"
"Is it fair that you always get what you want?" asked the maiden. The king
thought about this. And then changing the direction of the conversation,
the maiden added "and what of the desires of the people of the kingdom? Do
they ever get what they want?" It was true that he had never considered the
desires of his people. In fact, he had never considered that they had
desires.  "But don't they just want what I want?" asked the king. "Maybe"
said the maiden, "but I think you should ask them."

"Oh" said the king, and then "Hmm" and then "Well" and then "That is
exactly what I will do." excited with the thought of doing something to
please the maiden.

When the king returned his ministers were happy to find him alive and well.
He told them of his curious conversation with the maiden and said that it
was time to ask the people of the kingdom what they wanted. "Well, the
people want what you want sire", said Minister Or. "Maybe" said the king
feeling quite clever for the first time in his life.

The next day, the people of the kingdom were called into the royal
courtyard where the king could address them all at once and after a short
preamble he got to the point. "...and now you must tell me what you want."

For a while no one spoke. Even those old enough to remember having their
own desires could hardly think of what to say. Finally, a young boy spoke
up and said, "I would like a pony" He made his request so quietly that the
king had to ask him to repeat it, but as soon as the king heard it, he
immediately sent a page to the royal stables to find a pony for the boy.
The next desire came from a man who had lost one of his hens recently.
Another page was sent to the royal hennery to find the man a replacement. 

And so for a while the statements of desire continued in an orderly
fashion. But as the day wore on, the people became less patient as they
watched their neighbors having their desires granted and began to long for
the granting of their own. People started to shout over each other and the
mood of the crowd darkened. 

Sensing danger, the king became alarmed and begged his ministers to calm
the crowd. When the king regained their attention he gave his guarantee
that all desires would be met. But he said he had grown tired and would
have to resume the process first thing tomorrow.

The next day a more orderly process was established that involved stanchons
and tickets. But as the week wore on the granting of desires became more
difficult. The royal hennery and stables contained only so many hens and
horses. Some of the latest desires expressed by the people were no longer
so simple. Some neighbors began to use their desires merely as a means to
gain advantage over their fellow neighbors. And more and more the desire of
one person was incompatible with the desire of another.

By the end of week, the people had breached the walls of the castle as they
no longer asked but demanded the fulfillment of their desires. The future
of the kingdom had never looked so bleak. But when the crowd finally
reached the king hiding alone in the inner chamber of his inner court they
came to a halt. A few shouted, "We demand..." but the king just looked out
at them silently from behind a chair his eyes wide and blinking. One or two
attempted to raise a battle cry but these petered out on quiet notes.

Slowly fists were unclenched and arms un-raised as they began to realize
that what could be gained had been gained and what had been gained was not
what they wanted. And so slowly they turned to leave the castle and walk
back to their homes. 

Within the castle, the glass was swept and the doors repaired. The king
returned to his throne and the very next day the ministers gather round the
king and wisely suggested a return to the status quo. "Yes, Yes." agreed
the king also desperate to quickly put the past couple of weeks behind him.

And so the ministers waited while he sat on his throne. As the waiting
became awkward, the king looked around and said, "Well what do you want me
to do?" Minister Or finally spoke up and said, "Well sire, we were waiting
for you to express a desire."  "Oh, right" said the king as if this had
been obvious to him as well.

And then everyone waited some more. The king furrowed his brow, rubbed his
chin, pursed his lips and generally expressed all the expressions of a
person working hard in thought. But try as he might, desire escaped him. No
matter how much he furrowed or rubbed or pursed he simply could not think
of anything he wanted. Where had all his desires gone he thought? Had he
simply used them all up. No one seemed to know. 

His ministers offered many tempting suggestions, but nothing seemed to stir
his passion.

Minister Ub, who sometimes seemed too clever for his own good, suggested
that the king was having trouble coming up with a desire precisely because
he was trying too hard to come up with a desire. This made no sense to
anyone else, but they were all willing to give it try, if only to avoid
having Ub launch into another longwinded explanation of his theory.

For a few days, no one mentioned desires at all, and neither did the king.

Their efforts continued until it became apparent that the only desire left
in the kingdom was for the king to have a desire, and as hope faded that
this desire might ever be fulfilled, a grey and hard melancholy set in.

The king sat on his throne. The ministers returned to their chambers. The
people muddled in the town and the kingdom began to drift. No one wanted
anything and so no one did anything. 

As time wore on, the melancholy that had infected the hearts of the people
spread through the land and even beyond. Hardly a crow was heard to caw.
Cats were seen letting mice pass by unharmed. Even the wind could muster no
more than a breeze and clouds just limped across the sky. 

The maiden who lived on the far edge of the kingdom had remained mostly
immune from troubles of the kingdom. So far, the only exceptions had been
that she was running low on flour and her horse would soon need new shoes.

Then one morning, as she rose from a restless sleep, she noticed the
morning light was not where it should be. As usual the sun peaked out from
behind the earth but instead of being on the coming up side of her house,
it was on the going down side and seemed to just sit there as if suspended
in the sky. It appeared that on the previous evening the sun had simply
stopped on its way to bed possibly exhausted from a long days work.

The morning or evening, for it was hard to say which, remained dark as dusk
and the maiden let out a long sigh as she accepted that she could no longer
ignore the problems of the kingdom.

She arrived to find people milling about. The guards were no longer at
their posts. The ministers were no where to be found. The king sat on his
throne, gaunt and silent. He did not even seem to notice her enter his
chamber. 

A minister wandered in the room and seeing the maiden asked with more
excitement than had been felt in the kingdom in weeks asked, "Do you know
what the kings wants?" The maiden looked at him as if he had no more sense
than a rose, which might have been exactly the case, and barked, "Get the
king some breakfast!" Immediately, the minister left to fetch a breakfast
for the king. 

For the next week, the maiden went about ordering the kingdom back into
action. Bakers were set to baking and millers set to milling. Horses were
groomed and houses repaired. For the more the more difficult tasks such as
those involving wind, rain and other natural phenomenon, she called in the
royal wizards to help.

The kingdom once again bustled with activity, but the maiden found her job
overwhelming. Each day she had to decide what the king would have for
breakfast, how many loaves the baker would bake and if it was going to be
cloudy. The maiden had no interest in managing such details and wondered
how the king could have possibly enjoyed his former life. More importantly,
she wanted to get back to her own life on the edge of the kingdom.  

And so going forward she included in her commands a regular date and time
for every activity. Every Monday, the king ate two fried eggs, the baker
baked three dozen loaves of bread and there was not a cloud in the sky. One
by one she tied up loose ends down to the color of the king's shoes.  And
when she was finally done, she breathed a long sigh of relief and stepped
back to watch with pride as the kingdom marched along with perfect rhythm
like a wind-up Christmas village in a shop window display.
