The Story of King Ib 

To say that King Ib was a man of habit would be an understatement. Every
morning he rose at six and ate breakfast at seven. His lunch was served at
noon with dinner following at five. By eight o'clock, he was in bed and
fast sleep.  Only his dinner menu varied by the day of the week with fish
on Monday, mutton on Tuesday and so on.

All of his habits including his meetings with ministers, walks in the
garden and formal banquets were arranged to punctuate his days, weeks and
months at regular intervals. It was not only the king's habits, but the
habits of his entire kingdom that commenced in a mechanically predictable
pattern. At three o'clock each day you could expect to see the baker
passing the florist on his way to deliver a dozen pasteries to the castle,
and the florist inside his shop preparing bouquets for the evenings meal.

But the king, and so the kingdom, had not always been this way. King Ib was
the only child of King Et and Queen An and they were always very good to
their little prince. Some might argue, too good. It was their desire that
their son's desires never go unmet. He ate what he liked and had meals when
he wanted. He had ponies and playmates and even won games when he wished.
Instead of surprising the prince on his birthdays, the king and queen
simply asked him what he wanted and made sure he got it. 

The prince was always happy as long as he got what he wanted, and he
always got what he wanted, so he was always happy.

It came to pass that the king and queen both died, but the kingdom had
become accustomed to granting the now young king's wishes and so the habit
continued.

Then one afternoon young king Ib, while riding in his coach, spied a maiden
gathering flowers in a park. He had never seen her before, so knew that
she must be new to the kingdom. As he approached, she rose and wiped her
brow. She stood gazing past him and into her own thoughts.

As he watched her standing there, a desire stirred in him more powerful than he
had ever felt before. Without exchanging a single word, he decided that she
should be his queen and asked his ministers to make arrangements for his
marriage. Immediately a date was set and work begun to prepare for a royal
wedding. A young and trusted minister named Or was dispatched to find the young
maiden and inform her of the news. 

When Or found her, she was living alone in a small cottage on the edge of the
kingdom. He informed her of the wedding, and as he began to describe her
role as the future queen something happened that had never happened before.
She said "No."  He continued with his description barely acknowledging her
answer because it was to a question that he had not even asked. When
finally the minister realized something was wrong he stopped.  He stood
looking at her without knowing what to say.

Given that there seemed to be some confusion. The young maiden clarified her
feelings, saying, "I have no intention of marrying the king" Young Or opened
his mouth, but all that came out was "Ahh" and then when he had slightly
recovered "Yes...I will inform the king." The minister returned to the castle
fearing for his job if not for his very life and told the king his story.

The king listened to Or and did not say a word. He felt the painful sense of
desire that results from not getting what one deeply desires, and then he felt
fear. Suddenly, his world had stopped behaving in a way that it had always
behaved before. It was as if one day, the sun had one day simply decided not to
rise.

When Or finished his story, the king slowly got up from his chair and walked
into his chamber. He climbed into the royal bed and pulled the royal covers
over his royal head. 

Each of his ministers tried to appease him by bringing him things he had
desired in the past, but what he wanted was what he wanted, not what he had
wanted and the only thing he wanted was to marry the girl he saw in the park.

Finally Ut, his oldest and wised minister, was called in to help. "Ut, what
should I do", the king moaned from beneath the sheets. You should order her to
marry you, replied Ut. The king was silent for a moment and then peaked out at
Ut. "Order her to marry me? Yes, yes, of course" the king said. "And how should
we go about doing that?" he asked. For the king had never ordered anyone to do
anything before. Ut said that he would take care of the matter and sent two of
the kings guards off to the maiden's house.

After being shown in, the guards read the royal decree ordering the maiden
to marry the king. The maiden looked up from her mending and said, "I am
sorry, but I won't." Not knowing what else to do, the guards returned to the
castle and relayed their news.

Minister Ut's voice betrayed some concern when he told the king the news, but
immediately suggested a new strategy. The king should force the maiden to marry
him. "Yes, yes, we must use force" the king responded but did not bother to ask
Ut about how to go about this, for the king had never forced anyone to do
anything before.

Again, the guards were dispatched to the maiden's house though this time armed
with swords. Entering the house, they brandished their swords and demanded that
the maiden marry the king. The maiden looked up from her washing and said, "No".
Having no idea what to do next, the guards returned to the castle.

Ut now began to worry. It seemed they were dealing with more powerful creature
than he had first suspected. He began to fear for the king's life. He tried to
convince the king that maybe he should reconsider his desire to marry the
maiden and even suggested that his own niece had always been very fond of the
king.

The king went to bed that night feeling even worse than before. His dreams
knocked him about all night and finally tossed him awake in the wee hours of
the next morning. He immediately summoned his guards to take him to the
maiden's house.

Entering the maiden's house, looking disheveled and exhausted, and without
regard for the usual formalities of conversation he said to the maiden,
"Why won't you marry me?". 

The maiden looked up at the king and said, "Because I don't want to marry
you." and then to fill the silence, "I generally only do things that I want
to do." "So do I!" exclaimed the king, excited that they had found some
common ground. "But that is just the problem" said the maiden.  "Our
desires are incompatible." "Incompatible" said the King quietly to himself
liking the sound of the word but not its meaning.  

"But how can this be possible?" exclaimed the king. "Everything is
possible." said the maiden. "But it has never happened before." said the
king. "That is true of lots of things" she said. He eyed her warily. 

And then with no warning to himself or anyone else, he threw himself into a
king-sized tantrum complete with kicking and screaming and crying and after
finally exhausting himself and falling into a unkingly-like ball on the
floor, he peaked out with one eye to see if his performance had had its
desired effect. 

Looking non-plussed, the maiden suggested, "Maybe your whole premise is
wrong." "My what?" said the king addressing her from the floor. "Your way
of going about things, always just getting what you want." "But it has
always worked" he complained.  "Until now." she said. 

The king lay on the floor staring at a small crack in the ceiling and
thinking it looked like a rabbit. And then in an uncharacteristically sober
tone said, "Well I don't know what else to do." 

"Well what do you want to do?" asked the maiden. "Isn't that just the
problem" said the king soberly. For a while the king just lay silently
staring at the ceiling until he drifted into sleep because there seemed to
be nothing else left to do.

The maiden having gone back to her chores now looked down at the king lying
on her floor, a bejeweled lump of velvet and fur, with head and limbs
splayed to no advantage, his mouth agape and humid and emitting a
faint whistle with every breath. What had been mildly amusing was now
irksome and more importantly in the way of her path to the cupboard.

She woke him with a splash of cold water and guided him to a cart she had
hitched to her horse. The king sat quiet and disoriented all the way to the
castle where she dumped him at the gate and returned home.

After a few minutes the king spoke. "Well, what shall we do?" No one was
sure how to answer until Ut finally said, "I suggest we put the past few
weeks behind us and return to our...hmm, normal routines." Everone nodded
and the king said, "Yes, yes, I quite agree. Let us get back to our normal
routines."

And so the ministers waited while he sat on his throne. As the waiting
became awkward, the king looked around and said, "Well what do you want me
to do?" Minister Or finally spoke up and said, "Well sire, we were waiting
for you to express a desire."  "Oh, right" said the king as if this had
been obvious to him as well.

And then everyone waited some more. The king furrowed his brow, rubbed his
chin, pursed his lips and generally expressed all the expressions of a
person working hard in thought. But try as he might, desire escaped him. No
matter how much he furrowed or rubbed or pursed he simply could not think
of anything he wanted. After several days had passed, he began to wonder
where had all his desires gone? Had he simply used them all up. No one
seemed to know. 

Minister Ub, who everyone thought thought too much, suggested that the king
was having trouble coming up with a desire precisely because he was trying
too hard to come up with a desire. This made no sense to anyone else, but
they were all willing to give it try, if only to avoid having Ub launch
into another long winded explanation of his theory.

For a few days, no one mentioned desires at all, and neither did the king.

Their efforts continued until it became apparent that the only desire left
in the castle was for the king to have a desire. None of the ministers knew
what to do.

Meanwhile in the kingdom, the villagers had not heard from their king in
weeks. Nor had they heard from any of the ministers. There was some relief
at not being subjected to the usual frenzy of the king's whims and wishes,
but there was also some concern and some restlessness. "What should we do?"
said the shoemaker to the blacksmith who happened to be walking by his shop
one day. "Do whatever you want?" the blacksmith responded, doing his best
to convey a sense of feeling carefree. "Look at me." he went on to explain,
"I am taking a walk." as if to further make his point. The shoemaker looked
at the blacksmith and thought it a very poor example.  "What is the point
of taking a walk?" he asked. "Does there need to be a point?" responded the
blacksmith slightly disheartened that his performance and not been more
well received. "Well, it certainly helps." suggested the shoemaker.  "Oh
hum" said the blacksmith and continued on his walk.

As time wore on, their nerves were frayed with worry and wonder about their
uncertain future. Arguments broke out among friends. The dressmaker and
tailor even came to blows over a disagreement, the details of which neither
could remember when it was all over.

Finally, word was passed around the village that they should all meet to
discuss their troubles. The meeting began in chaos, as no one took charge
and so no one knew where to direct their comments. After a few minutes, the
baker stood on his chair and speaking loudly above the crowd suggested "We
should go to see the king" adding that, "He will have an answer for us."
Everyone was quiet for a moment as it seemed like a good suggestion. "But
what if the king does not want to see us." suggested someone from the
crowd. They had always only done what the king wanted much less even
considered doing what he didn't want. "But what if he is in trouble, and
needs our help?" suggested another voice. There was a mummer of approval at
this and it was quickly agreed that the baker's suggestion was a good one.

The villagers immediately marched to the castle and knocked on the castle
gate. Receiving them, a guard went to tell the ministers that the villagers
wanted to see the king. Minister Og looked at minister Ez and said, "But
they can't see the king, not like this." "Why not?" said Ez. "We have done
all we can do. There seems no reason to continue hiding our troubles from
the villagers." adding "Maybe they can help. They could hardly make it
worse."

The villagers crowded their way into the royal hall anxious to see their
king after so many weeks, but when they saw him sitting listlessly on his
throne their hearts sank. It was painfully obvious that their king was not
well. "What is wrong?" they asked. "We don't know." responded one of the
ministers. "What does he want?" they asked. "The is just the problem." said
another minister. "He doesn't want anything." "Have you suggested
shovelboard?" said one of the villagers, for it was well known that the
king loved shovelboard. "Of course." said one of the ministers "and we
tried a dozen other games as well." which he went on to list. "Have you
tried not mentioning..." "Yes, yes, not mentioning any desires at all." the
minister interrupted slightly annoyed, "It didn't help." 

For a while everyone was silent while they looked at the king searching for
some sign that his old desirous self was still lurking behind his sullen
presence. 

Then the baker, who had each year made the most enormous and festive cake
for the kings harvest fest, said quite loudly, "The king wants to host a
harvest fest next weekend and he wants me to make his favorite cake."
Everyone looked at the baker silently not sure what to make of his claim.
The baker looked right back and gave no evidence that he was anything but
quite sure. Then the florist said, "Yes, and he demands a bouquet of
flowers at every table."  "And he requests a new cape." said the tailor.
There were cries of "here, here" from the villagers. The butcher then
added, "The king would like sausage"  "and eggs" add the farmer. "for
breakfast every weekday morning at 8am."  The minister collared the nearest
page and demanded, "Are you writing this down?"

An so the villagers went on for most of the day until they had worked out a
schedule that would keep everyone busy from that day forward. And from that
day forward, the king played his part with no complaints and the villagers
remained busy and everyone in the kingdom lived happily ever after.
