The Story of King Ib 

To say that King Ib was a man of habit would be an understatement. Every
morning he rose at six and ate breakfast at seven. His lunch was served at
noon with dinner following at five. By eight o'clock, he was in bed and
fast sleep.  Only his dinner menu varied by the day of the week with fish
on Monday, mutton on Tuesday and so on.

All of his habits including his meetings with ministers, walks in the
garden and formal banquets were arranged to punctuate his days, weeks and
months at regular intervals. It was not only the king's habits, but the
habits of his entire kingdom that commenced in a mechanically predictable
pattern. At one o'clock each day you could expect to see the baker passing
the florist on his way to deliver a dozen pasteries to the castle, and the
florist inside his shop preparing bouquets for the evenings meal.

But the king, and so the kingdom, had not always been this way. King Ib was
the only child of King Et and Queen An and they were always very good to
their little prince. Some might argue, too good. It was their desire that
their son's desires never go unmet. He ate what he liked and had meals when
he wanted. He had ponies and playmates and even won games when he wished.
Instead of surprising the prince on his birthdays, the king and queen
simply asked him what he wanted and made sure he got it. 

The prince was always happy as long as he got what he wanted, and he
always got what he wanted, so he was always happy.

It came to pass that the king and queen both died, but the kingdom had
become accustomed to granting the now young king's wishes and so the habit
continued.

Then one afternoon young king Ib, while riding in his coach, spied a maiden
gathering flowers in a park. He had never seen her before, so knew that
she must be new to the kingdom. As he approached, she rose and wiped her
brow. She stood gazing past him and into her own thoughts.

As he watched her standing there, a desire stirred in him more powerful than he
had ever felt before. Without exchanging a single word, he decided that she
should be his queen and asked his ministers to make arrangements for his
marriage. Immediately a date was set and work begun to prepare for a royal
wedding. A young and trusted minister named Or was dispatched to find the young
maiden and inform her of the news. 

When Or found her, she was living alone in a small cottage on the edge of the
kingdom. He informed her of the wedding, and as he began to describe her
role as the future queen something happened that had never happened before.
She said "No."  He continued with his description barely acknowledging her
answer because it was to a question that he had not even asked. When
finally the minister realized something was wrong he stopped.  He stood
looking at her without knowing what to say.

Given that there seemed to be some confusion. The young maiden clarified her
feelings, saying, "I have no intention of marrying the king" Young Or opened
his mouth, but all that came out was "Ahh" and then when he had slightly
recovered "Yes...I will inform the king." The minister returned to the castle
fearing for his job if not for his very life and told the king his story.

The king listened to Or and did not say a word. He felt the painful sense of
desire that results from not getting what one deeply desires, and then he felt
fear. Suddenly, his world had stopped behaving in a way that it had always
behaved before. It was as if one day, the sun had one day simply decided not to
rise.

When Or finished his story, the king slowly got up from his chair and walked
into his chamber. He climbed into the royal bed and pulled the royal covers
over his royal head. 

Each of his ministers tried to appease him by bringing him things he had
desired in the past, but what he wanted was what he wanted, not what he had
wanted and the only thing he wanted was to marry the girl he saw in the park.

Finally Ut, his oldest and wised minister, was called in to help. "Ut, what
should I do", the king moaned from beneath the sheets. You should order her to
marry you, replied Ut. The king was silent for a moment and then peaked out at
Ut. "Order her to marry me? Yes, yes, of course" the king said. "And how should
we go about doing that?" he asked. For the king had never ordered anyone to do
anything before. Ut said that he would take care of the matter and sent two of
the kings guards off to the maiden's house.

After being shown in, the guards read the royal decree ordering the maiden
to marry the king. The maiden looked up from her mending and said, "I am
sorry, but I won't." Not knowing what else to do, the guards returned to the
castle and relayed their news.

Minister Ut's voice betrayed some concern when he told the king the news, but
immediately suggested a new strategy. The king should force the maiden to marry
him. "Yes, yes, we must use force" the king responded but did not bother to ask
Ut about how to go about this, for the king had never forced anyone to do
anything before.

Again, the guards were dispatched to the maiden's house though this time armed
with swords. Entering the house, they brandished their swords and demanded that
the maiden marry the king. The maiden looked up from her washing and said, "No".
Having no idea what to do next, the guards returned to the castle.

Ut now began to worry. It seemed they were dealing with more powerful creature
than he had first suspected. He began to fear for the king's life. He tried to
convince the king that maybe he should reconsider his desire to marry the
maiden and even suggested that his own niece had always been very fond of the
king.

The king went to bed that night feeling even worse than before. His dreams
knocked him about all night and finally tossed him awake in the wee hours of
the next morning. He immediately summoned his guards to take him to the
maiden's house.

Entering the maiden's house, looking disheveled and exhausted, and without
regard for the usual formalities of conversation he said to the maiden,
"Why won't you marry me?". 

The maiden looked up at the king and said, "Because I don't want to marry
you." and then to fill the silence, "I generally only do things that I want
to do." "So do I!" exclaimed the king, excited that they had found some
common ground. "But that is just the problem" said the maiden.  "Our
desires are incompatible." "Incompatible" said the King quietly to himself
liking the sound of the word but not its meaning.  

"But how can this be possible?" exclaimed the king. "Everything is
possible." said the maiden. "But it has never happened before." said the
king. "That is true of lots of things" she said. He eyed her warily. 

And then with no warning to himself or anyone else, he threw himself into a
king-sized tantrum complete with kicking and screaming and crying and after
finally exhausting himself and falling into a unkingly-like ball on the
floor, he peaked out with one eye to see if his performance had had its
desired effect. 

Looking non-plussed, the maiden suggested, "Maybe your whole premise is
wrong." "My what?" said the king addressing her from the floor. "Your way
of going about things, always just getting what you want." "But it has
always worked" he complained.  "Until now." she said. 

The king lay on the floor staring at a small crack in the ceiling and
thinking it looked like a rabbit. And then in an uncharacteristically sober
tone said, "Well I don't know what else to do." 

"Well what do you want to do?" asked the maiden. "Is'nt that just the
problem" said the king soberly. "It is not doing what you want that is
the problem, but what you want to do."

"What is wrong with what I want to do?" he asked. "Your desires are
designed to serve only you." "Who else should they serve?" "They could
serve the people of your kingdom." "But then they would not be my desires."
he said as he wondered if the people of his kingdom really had any desires.
It was not something he had previously considered. 

"Your desire could be to fill the desire of another." said the maiden.  "I
suppose." said the king, "but what would be the point?" "That is not a
question I can answer." said the maiden. 

"Oh" said the king as he yawned broadly and then "Hmmm" and then he closed
his eyes and fell fast asleep for it had been quite an exhausting day.

When the king returned his ministers were happy to find him alive and well.
He told them of his curious conversation with the maiden and said that it
was time to ask the people of the kingdom what they wanted. "Well, the
people want what you want sire", said Minister Or. "Maybe, and then again,
maybe not" said the king feeling clever for the first time in his life.

The next day, the people of the kingdom were called into the royal
courtyard where the king could address them all at once and after a short
preamble he got to the point. "...and now you must tell me what you want."

For a while no one spoke. Even those old enough to remember having their
own desires could hardly think of what to say. Finally, a young boy spoke
up and said, "I would like a pony" He made his request so quietly that the
king had to ask him to repeat it, but as soon as the king heard it, he
immediately sent a page to the royal stables to find a pony for the boy.
The next desire came from a man who had lost one of his hens recently.
Another page was sent to the royal hennery to find the man a replacement. 

For a while the statements of desire continued in an orderly fashion. But
as the day wore on, the people became less patient as they watched their
neighbors having their desires granted and began to long for the granting
of their own. People started to shout over each other and by the end of the
day the mood of the crowd darkened. 

Sensing danger, the king became alarmed and begged his ministers to calm
the crowd. When the king regained their attention he gave his guarantee
that all desires would be met. But he said he had grown tired and would
have to resume the process first thing tomorrow.

The next day a more orderly process was established that involved stanchons
and tickets. But as the week wore on the granting of desires became more
difficult. The royal hennery and stables contained only so many hens and
horses. And more and more the desire of one person was incompatible with
the desire of another.

Toward the end of the week, a rumor began to make its way through the crowd
that the kingdom's coffiers were becoming empty. Quickly their desires
bleed to panic and panic propelled them forward like a giant wave breaching
the walls of the castle. 

The future of the kingdom had never looked so bleak.  

Easily overcoming the guards, the crowd poured through the halls of the
castle smashing and looting as they went. Finally they found the king
hiding alone in the inner chamber of his inner court. Surrounding the king
the people shook their fists and shouted their desires, but the king just
looked out at them from behind his chair his eyes wide and blinking and
saying nothing.

They continued to shake and shout but were unable to provoke a response
from the king. Unrewarded, their anger fell to calm. For a moment they just
looked at the king and he looked back. Then a voice from the crowd
addressed the king in anger, "What have you done?" "I gave you what you
wanted." "You gave us chickens and horses." "That is what you asked for."
For a moment there was silence. Then from another voice, "But you are the
king."

Accepting that what could be gained had been gained and what had been
gained was not what they wanted, they slowly left the castle and made their
way back to their homes. 

Within the castle, the glass was swept and the doors repaired. The king
returned to his throne and the very next day the ministers gather round the
king and wisely suggested a return to the status quo. "Yes, Yes." agreed
the king, also desperate to quickly put the past couple of weeks behind
him.

And so the ministers waited while he sat on his throne. As the waiting
became awkward, the king looked around and said, "Well what do you want me
to do?" Minister Or finally spoke up and said, "Well sire, we were waiting
for you to express a desire."  "Oh, right" said the king as if this had
been obvious to him as well.

And then everyone waited some more. The king furrowed his brow, rubbed his
chin, pursed his lips and generally expressed all the expressions of a
person working hard in thought. But try as he might, desire escaped him. No
matter how much he furrowed or rubbed or pursed he simply could not think
of anything he wanted. After several days had passed, he began to wonder
where had all his desires gone? Had he simply used them all up. No one
seemed to know. 

Minister Ub, who everyone thought thought too much, suggested that the king
was having trouble coming up with a desire precisely because he was trying
too hard to come up with a desire. This made no sense to anyone else, but
they were all willing to give it try, if only to avoid having Ub launch
into another longwinded explanation of his theory.

For a few days, no one mentioned desires at all, and neither did the king.

Their efforts continued until it became apparent that the only desire left
in the kingdom was for the king to have a desire, and as hope faded that
this desire might ever be fulfilled, a grey and dark meloncholy set in over
the kingdom.

The maiden, who lived on the far edge of the kingdom, had remained immune
from the troubles of the people in the village. Though she was beginning to
run low on flour and her horse would soon need new shoes and so she would
have to return the village soon.

Arriving early one morning, she stopped first at the blacksmith shop and
asked the blacksmith if he would shod her horse. He said he wasn't sure.
"What do you mean you are not sure. Either you will or you won't. There is
no being sure about it" "Ahh, if it were so simple." he said, "You see, I
am waiting for the king." "Waiting for the king? What are you waiting for
him to do?" she asked. "To decide what he wants." he said and the added,
"It has been a long time since he expressed a desire and we are expecting
quite a big one." 

"But why do you care what the king wants? Isn't what you want to do more
imporant?" asked the maiden.  "Oh, let's not get started on that one again.
We have went down that road before and it did not turn out so well."
replied the blacksmith. "I think it is best to just wait. I am sure it
won't be long."

The conversation seemed to be getting nowhere and so the maiden decided to
make her way to the miller to get some flour. Unfortunately, she found that
the miller was also waiting and was equally resolved in his . Had the whole
village gone mad? she thought.

She decided to find the king. She easily made her way into the castle and
the king's chamber finding him sitting on his throne looking pensive and
lean. Recognizing her as she entered he said, "Oh it's you" with some
surprise. "What brings you here?" "I came to get flour for my bread and
shoes for my horse." "Well, I can't very well help you with either." "You
should see the miller and the blacksmith." "I did and they were of no
help."

"I am sorry" he said. "Your kingdom is waiting for you to make a decision."
she said. "What should I do?" he asked with some hope in his voice. "What
do you want to do?" she asked. "That is just the problem." he said, "I
don't know." "You might start with having breakfast." suggested the maiden.
The king looked like he had not had a good meal in over a week. 

"Do you think I should?" he asked.  Realizing the situation called for more
authority, she said, "Yes, you should have breakfast." "Yes, of course."
said the king with a sense of resolve that had not been felt in the kingdom
for weeks. He immediately called for a minister to fetch him a breakfast.
Realizing that no invitation was forthcoming and because she was quite
hungry from her morning adventures, she suggested, "And you should invite
me to join you for breakfast" "Yes of course." said the king, "breakfast
for two."

As soon as the king finished his breakfast he asked the maiden, "What
should I do next?" "Do next?" the maiden thought. The situation was far
more dire than she had hoped. Trying not to hesitate she said, "Why you
should have lunch of course." The king immediately called his minister and
asked him to bring lunch. Realizing her mistake she said, "Oh you should
not have lunch right now, you should have lunch at noon." "Yes of course."
said the king and immediately amended his request. 

"So what should I do in the meantime." asked the king. "Hmm said the
maiden. I will need to think about this." The king looked a bit worried.
To calm his fears, the maiden said "You should just wait till lunch." He
seemed satisfied with this answer and just waited. 

The maiden was worried though. She had no intention of spending the rest of
her life making every decision for the king. She just wanted the kingdom to
go about its business so she could get back to her life on the edge of the
kingdom.

After an hour or so of thinking about the problem an idea finally came to
her. She asked the king, "Do you have a diary?" "Why yes." said the king,
"I have kept a diary since I was a child." She waited for a moment to see
if her question would trigger the natural suggestion of action, but as it
became apparent that the king had no further thought about the matter she
added, "You should have a minister bring me your diary." The king
immediately requested the diary for the maiden.

She then told the king that she needed to leave but would be back within a
week. The king looked satisfied seemingly aware that his future was set and
but seemingly unaware that the his future's horizon was only a few hours
away.

The king's diary was through containing a detailed account of all the kings
actions. A seemingly random set of events that followed some inner human
logic and that had propelled the kingdom along a generally peaceful and
prosperous path. Using the diary as a guide, she created a new book which
distilled the former actions of the king into routines that repeated on a
daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis. 

The routines were presented a rules for life and were wrapped in a story
that gave rational for their creation and evidence for their value. The
maiden who had never considered herself to be creative was quite proud of
the final product.

She returned to the kingdom to find the king in a dreadful state. He had
not fared well since about one o'clock on the day she left. His brief
experience of feeling secure had only made the emptiness of feeling
insecure less bearable. Excited to have her return, he told her of his
troubles and then asked asked, "What should I do?"

She showed the king the book and told him a story about how it was written
at the dawn of his very kingdom and how it had been followed for a thousand
years and then lost and how this loss had led to the great troubles the
kingdom was experiencing today. And the king very much enjoyed the story
and was not at all bothered by the odd coincidence that the maiden should
suddenly happen upon this book.

She than began to read from the book describing the ritual of life. The
king enjoyed this most of all, but said he would have a hard time keeping
it all straight. She suggested he entrust the keeping of the book to his
most trusted minister. Minister Ut was immediately called in and maiden
assigned him keeper of the book and responsible for ensuring that from this
day forward the law of book would forever be followed.

As she walked back to her cottage that evening, she noticed a star no more
than two thirds above the horizon twinkling down from the dome of the sky.
She had seen this star often but only now thought how it always seemed to
be in the same place every night, coming out early before most of the
others and a wave of loneliness swept over her such as she had never felt
before.
