The Story of King Ib 

To say that King Ib was a man of habit would be an understatement. Every
morning he rose at six and ate breakfast at seven. Lunch was served at noon
with dinner following at five. By eight o'clock, he was in bed and fast
sleep.  Only his dinner menu varied by the day of the week with fish on
Monday, mutton on Tuesday and so on.

All of his habits including his meetings with ministers, walks in the
garden and formal banquets were arranged to punctuate his days, weeks and
months at regular intervals. It was not only the king's habits, but the
habits of his entire kingdom that commenced in a mechanically predictable
pattern. At one o'clock each day you could expect to see the baker passing
the florist on his way to deliver a dozen pasteries to the castle, and the
florist inside his shop preparing bouquets for the evenings meal.

But the king, and so the kingdom, had not always been this way. King Ib was
the only child of King Et and Queen An and they were always very good to
their little prince. Some might argue, too good. It was their desire that
their son's desires never go unmet. He ate what he liked and had meals when
he wanted. He had ponies and playmates and even won games when he wished.
Instead of surprising the prince on his birthdays, the king and queen
simply asked him what he wanted and made sure he got it. 

The prince was always happy as long as he got what he wanted, and he
always got what he wanted, so he was always happy.

It came to pass that the king and queen both died, but the kingdom had
become accustomed to granting the now young king's wishes and so the habit
continued.

Then one afternoon young king Ib, while riding in his coach, spied a maiden
gathering flowers in the park. He had never seen her before, so knew that
she must be new to the kingdom. As he approached, she rose and wiped her
brow. She stood gazing past him and into her own thoughts.

As he watched her standing there, a desire stirred in him more powerful than he
had ever felt before. Without exchanging a single word, he decided that she
should be his queen and asked his ministers to make arrangements for his
marriage. Immediately a date was set and work begun to prepare for a royal
wedding. A young and trusted minister named Or was dispatched to find the young
maiden and inform her of the news. 

When Or found her, she was living alone in a small cabin on the edge of the
kingdom. He informed her of the wedding, and as he began to describe her
role as the future queen something happened that had never happened before.
She said "No."  He continued with his description barely acknowledging her
answer because it was to a question that he had not even asked. When
finally the minister realized something was wrong he stopped.  He stood
looking at her without knowing what to say.

Given that there seemed to be some confusion. The young maiden clarified her
feelings, saying, "I have no intention of marrying the king" Young Or opened
his mouth, but all that came out was "Ahh" and then when he had slightly
recovered "Yes...I will inform the king." The minister returned to the castle
fearing for his job if not for his very life and told the king his story.

The king listened to Or and did not say a word. He felt the painful sense of
desire that results from not getting what one deeply desires, and then he felt
fear. Suddenly, his world had stopped behaving in a way that it had always
behaved before. It was as if one day, the sun had one day simply decided not to
rise.

When Or finished his story, the king slowly got up from his chair and walked
into his chamber. He climbed into the royal bed and pulled the royal covers
over his royal head. 

Each of his ministers tried to appease him by bringing him things he had
desired in the past, but what he wanted was what he wanted, not what he had
wanted and the only thing he wanted was to marry the girl he saw in the park.

Finally Ut, his oldest and wised minister, was called in to help. "Ut, what
should I do", the king moaned from beneath the sheets. You should order her to
marry you, replied Ut. The king was silent for a moment and then peaked out at
Ut. "Order her to marry me? Yes, yes, of course" the king said. "And how should
we go about doing that?" he asked. For the king had never ordered anyone to do
anything before. Ut said that he would take care of the matter and sent two of
the kings guards off to the maiden's house.

After being shown in, the guards read the royal decree ordering the maiden
to marry the king. The maiden looked up from her mending and said, "I am
sorry, but I won't." Not knowing what else to do, the guards returned to the
castle and relayed their news.

Minister Ut's voice betrayed some concern when he told the king the news, but
immediately suggested a new strategy. The king should force the maiden to marry
him. "Yes, yes, we must use force" the king responded but did not bother to ask
Ut about how to go about this, for the king had never forced anyone to do
anything before.

Again, the guards were dispatched to the maiden's house though this time armed
with swords. Entering the house, they brandished their swords and demanded that
the maiden marry the king. The maiden looked up from her washing and said, "No".
Having no idea what to do next, the guards returned to the castle.

Ut now began to worry. It seemed they were dealing with more powerful creature
than he had first suspected. He began to fear for the king's life. He tried to
convince the king that maybe he should reconsider his desire to marry the
maiden and even suggested that his own niece had always been very fond of the
king.

The king went to bed that night feeling even worse than before. His dreams
knocked him about all night and finally tossed him awake in the wee hours of
the next morning. He immediately summoned his guards to take him to the
maiden's house.

Entering the maiden's house, looking disheveled and exhausted, and without
regard for the usual formalities of conversation he said to the maiden,
"Why won't you marry me?". 

The maiden looked up at the king and said, "Because I don't want to marry
you." and then to fill the silence, "I generally only do things that I want
to do." "So do I!" exclaimed the king, excited that they had found some
common ground. "But that is just the problem" said the maiden.  "Our
desires are incompatible." "Incompatible" said the King quietly to himself
liking the sound of the word but not its meaning.  

"But how can this be possible?" exclaimed the king. "Everything is
possible." said the maiden. "But it has never happened before." said the
king. "That is true of lots of things" He eyed her warily. 

And then with no warning to himself or anyone else, he threw himself into a
king-sized tantrum complete with kicking and screaming and crying and after
finally exhausting himself and falling into a unkingly-like ball on the
floor, he peaked out with one eye to see if his performance had had its
desired effect. 

Looking non-plussed, the maiden suggested, "Maybe your whole premise is
wrong." "My what?" said the king addressing her from the floor. "Your way
of going about things, always just getting what you want." "But it has
always worked" he complained.  "Until now." she said. 

The king lay on the floor staring at a small crack in the ceiling and
thinking it looked like a rabbit. And then in an uncharacteristically sober
tone said, "Well I don't know what else to do." 

"Well what do you want to do?" asked the maiden. "Is'nt that just the
problem" said the king. "It is not doing what you want that is the problem,
but what you want to do."

"What is wrong with what I want to do?" he asked. "Your desires are
designed to serve only you." "Who else should they serve?" "They could
serve the people of your kingdom." "But then they would not be my desires."
he said as he wondered if the people of his kingdom really had any desires.
It was not something he had previously considered. 

"Your desire could be to fill the desire of another." said the maiden.  "I
suppose." said the king, "but what would be the point?" "That is not a
question I can answer." said the maiden. 

"Oh" said the king as he yawned broadly and then "Hmmm" and then he closed
his eyes and fell fast asleep for it had been quite an exhausting day.

When the king returned his ministers were happy to find him alive and well.
He told them of his curious conversation with the maiden and said that it
was time to ask the people of the kingdom what they wanted. "Well, the
people want what you want sire", said Minister Or. "Maybe and then again,
maybe not" said the king feeling clever for the first time in his life.

The next day, the people of the kingdom were called into the royal
courtyard where the king could address them all at once and after a short
preamble he got to the point. "...and now you must tell me what you want."

For a while no one spoke. Even those old enough to remember having their
own desires could hardly think of what to say. Finally, a young boy spoke
up and said, "I would like a pony" He made his request so quietly that the
king had to ask him to repeat it, but as soon as the king heard it, he
immediately sent a page to the royal stables to find a pony for the boy.
The next desire came from a man who had lost one of his hens recently.
Another page was sent to the royal hennery to find the man a replacement. 

For a while the statements of desire continued in an orderly fashion. But
as the day wore on, the people became less patient as they watched their
neighbors having their desires granted and began to long for the granting
of their own. People started to shout over each other and the mood of the
crowd darkened. 

Sensing danger, the king became alarmed and begged his ministers to calm
the crowd. When the king regained their attention he gave his guarantee
that all desires would be met. But he said he had grown tired and would
have to resume the process first thing tomorrow.

The next day a more orderly process was established that involved stanchons
and tickets. But as the week wore on the granting of desires became more
difficult. The royal hennery and stables contained only so many hens and
horses. And more and more the desire of one person was incompatible with
the desire of another.

One morning toward the end of the week, a rumor quickly made its way
through the crowd that the kingdom's coffiers were empty. All of the
people's frustrations that had been directed in many directions were
suddenly directed toward the castle. The crowd rushed forward and like a
giant wave breached the walls of the castle. 

The future of the kingdom looked bleak.  

Easily overcoming the guards and ministers, the crowd poured through the
halls of the castle knocking and smashing as they went. Finally it reached
the king hiding alone in the inner chamber of his inner court. Surrounding
the king the people raised their fists and shouted their demands, but the
king just looked out at them silently from behind a chair his eyes wide and
blinking.

For a few moments they continued to rattle and roar and shout, but the
kings repsonse remained the same. Slowly their voices lowered, their fists
unclenched and arms un-raised as they began to realize that what could be
gained had been gained and what had been gained was not what they wanted.
And so slowly they turned to leave the castle and walk back to their homes. 

Within the castle, the glass was swept and the doors repaired. The king
returned to his throne and the very next day the ministers gather round the
king and wisely suggested a return to the status quo. "Yes, Yes." agreed
the king, also desperate to quickly put the past couple of weeks behind
him.

And so the ministers waited while he sat on his throne. As the waiting
became awkward, the king looked around and said, "Well what do you want me
to do?" Minister Or finally spoke up and said, "Well sire, we were waiting
for you to express a desire."  "Oh, right" said the king as if this had
been obvious to him as well.

And then everyone waited some more. The king furrowed his brow, rubbed his
chin, pursed his lips and generally expressed all the expressions of a
person working hard in thought. But try as he might, desire escaped him. No
matter how much he furrowed or rubbed or pursed he simply could not think
of anything he wanted. After several days had passed, he began to wonder
where had all his desires gone? Had he simply used them all up.  No one
seemed to know. 

Minister Ub, known for his theories, suggested that the king was having
trouble coming up with a desire precisely because he was trying too hard to
come up with a desire. This made no sense to anyone else, but they were all
willing to give it try, if only to avoid having Ub launch into another
longwinded explanation of his theory.

For a few days, no one mentioned desires at all, and neither did the king.

Their efforts continued until it became apparent that the only desire left
in the kingdom was for the king to have a desire, and as hope faded that
this desire might ever be fulfilled, a grey and dark meloncholy set in over
the kingdom.

The people no longer knew what they wanted and so they wanted very little.
Their lack of demand was followed by a lack of supply and, in turn, a
breakdown in the economic force of these two factors working in
collaboration. Falling to the least common denominator of human existence,
the people ate and slept and sheltered themselves, though being generations
removed from this sort of existence, they were out of practice.  

This downturn in providence was solely contained to the humans of the
kingdom. Dogs still chased cats and cats still chased mice as they had done
for millenia regardless of the perturbations of their human hosts.

The maiden, who lived on the far edge of the kingdom, had remained mostly
immune from the troubles of the kingdom. Though she was beginning to run
low on flour and her horse would soon need new shoes. 

When she finaly made her way to town she arrived to find the general store
out of flour and the blacksmith nowhere to be found. Realizing that
something was very wrong, she made her way to the castle. The posts
unguarded, she easily made her way to king's chamber. She found him sitting
silent and gaunt on his throne apparently unaware that she was even in the
room.

A minister wandered into the room and she asked him "What is wrong with the
king?" "He has no desire." he replied. "None at all?" "We have been waiting
for weeks...or has it been months? I can't seem to keep track. He just sits
there." The maiden looked more closely at the king who seemed to finally
acknowledge her existence with a slow roll of his head. "Does he eat?" she
asked. "Not much" he replied.

Frustrated, she turned to the minister and said "Make the king his
breakfast" and then added "make it a royal breakfast".  

Responding to the first command he had heard in weeks, the minister hurried
excitedly to take his message to the royal chef. The royal chef set the
cooks to cooking who in turn set the bakers to baking and miller to milling
and servers to serving. And in short order, like ripples in a pond, the
workings of the kingdom where set back in motion until the king's meal was
prepared and delivered to his chamber. 

Many had gathered round to watch the king enjoy his first proper meal in
months. When he finished, he looked up with a smile of satisfaction. He
then looked around at all those gathered in the chamber and seemed about to
speak when his smile suddenly gave way to a look of confusion. It was as if
he had just lost his place in a story he was telling. Everyone in the room
looked over at the maiden as if to say, "What next?"

"Well" she said, "Is it not obvious that lunch follows breakfast?" And as
the process of preparing the kings lunch began, the maiden sighed with :wq 


The maiden sighed. It was then that she began to write out schedule for
every meal. She decided It was then that the maiden decided the king would
eat for breakfast tomorrow what he ate for breakfast today and from that
day forward. She then wrote out schedule for every meal and felt generous
enough to vary his evening meal by the day of the week.

For the next week, the maiden went about ordering the kingdom back into
action. Bakers were set to baking and millers were set to milling. Horses
were groomed and houses repaired. 

The process was not simple a matter, for every task had to be coordinated
with every other task so that loaves of bread were neither wasted nor
wanted. Wheat supply needed to match bread production and bread production
needed to match hunger and hunger was determined by work and so on. Even
the schedule of deliveries had to be coordinated so that the florist did
not collide with the 

And slowly a pattern emerged of neatly interlocking pieces. And one by one
she tied up loose ends down to the color of the king's shoes.  And when she
was finally done, until finally, she acknowledged her own needs and
dependance on the kingdom and reluctangly wove herself own needs into the
process. She walked home feeling more lonely than she had ever felt before.

she stepped back and breathed a sigh of hard work, and
then, quite as a surprise, a saddness welled up in her, so pure, that and
so she went back to her cottage on the edge of the kingdom and lived there
alone for the rest of her life.
