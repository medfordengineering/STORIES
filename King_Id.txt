The Story of King Id 

To say that King Id was a man of habit would be an understatement. Every
morning he rose at six and ate breakfast at seven. Lunch was served at noon
with dinner following at five. By eight o'clock, he was in bed and fast sleep.
Only his dinner menu varied by the day of the week with fish on Monday, mutton
on Tuesday and so on.

All of his habits including his meetings with ministers, walks in the
garden and formal banquets were arranged to punctuate his days, weeks and
months at regular intervals. It was not only the king's habits, but the
habits of his entire kingdom that commenced in a mechanically predictable
pattern. At one o'clock each day you could expect to see the baker passing
the florist on his way to deliver a dozen pasteries to the castle, and the
florist inside his shop preparing bouquets for the evenings meal.

Even the heavens conformed to the unusual nature of the kingdom with the sun
crossing the horizon at exactly six each morning and passing below exactly 12
hours later. Rain fell on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons with partly cloudy
skies during the reminder of the week.

But the king, and so the kingdom, had not always been this way. King Id was
the only child of King Et and Queen An and they were always very good to
their little prince. Some might argue, too good. It was their desire that
their son's desires never go unmet. He ate what he liked and had meals when
he wanted. He had ponies and playmates and even won games when he wished.
Instead of surprising the prince on his birthdays, the king and queen
simply asked him what he wanted and made sure he got it. No desire was too
grand for their son. When the king wanted a breezy day to fly his kite, the
royal magicians were employed to make it so. 

The prince was always happy as long as he got what he wanted, and he
always got what he wanted, so he was always happy.

It came to pass that the king and queen both died, but the kingdom had become
accustomed to granting the now young king's wishes and so the habit continued
with the patterns of the kingdom following the daily whims of the king. 

Then one afternoon young king Id, while riding in his coach, spied a maiden
tending to the flowers in the park. He had never seen her before, so knew that
she must be new to the kingdom. As he approached, she rose and wiped her brow.
She stood gazing past him and into her own thoughts.

As he watched her standing there, a desire stirred in him more powerful than he
had ever felt before. Without exchanging a single word, he decided that she
should be his queen and asked his ministers to make arrangements for his
marriage. Immediately a date was set and work begun to prepare for a royal
wedding. A young and trusted minister named Or was dispatched to find the young
maiden and inform her of the news. 

When Or found her, she was at her Aunt's house where she was living after
having moved from a neighboring kingdom. He informed her of the wedding, and as
he began to describe her role as the future queen something happened that had
never happened before. She said no.  He continued with his description barely
acknowledging her answer because it was to a question that he had not even
asked. When finally the minister realized something was wrong he stopped.  He
stood looking at her without knowing what to say.

Given that there seemed to be some confusion. The young maiden clarified her
feelings, saying, "I have no intention of marrying the king" Young Or opened
his mouth, but all that came out was "Ahh" and then when he had slightly
recovered "Yes...I will inform the king." The minister returned to the castle
fearing for his job if not for his very life and told the king his story.

The king listened to Or and did not say a word. He felt the painful sense of
desire that results from not getting what one deeply desires, and then he felt
fear. Suddenly, his world had stopped behaving in a way that it had always
behaved before. It was as if one day, the sun had one day simply decided not to
rise.

When Or finished his story, the king slowly got up from his chair and walked
into his chamber. He climbed into the royal bed and pulled the royal covers
over his royal head. 

Each of his ministers tried to appease him by bringing him things he had
desired in the past, but what he wanted was what he wanted, not what he had
wanted and the only thing he wanted was to marry the girl he saw in the park.

Finally Ut, his oldest and wised minister, was called in to help. "Ut, what
should I do", the king moaned from beneath the sheets. You should order her to
marry you, replied Ut. The king was silent for a moment and then peaked out at
Ut. "Order her to marry me. Yes, yes, of course" the king said. "And how should
we go about doing that?" he asked. For the king had never ordered anyone to do
anything before. Ut said that he would take care of the matter and sent two of
the kings guards off to the maiden's house.

After being shown in, the guards read the royal decree ordering the maiden
to marry the king. The maiden looked up from her mending and said, "I am
sorry but I won't." Not knowing what else to do, the guards returned to the
castle and relayed their news.

Minister Ut's voice betrayed some concern when he told the king the news, but
immediately suggested a new strategy. The king should force the maiden to marry
him. "Yes, yes, we must use force" the king responded but did not bother to ask
Ut about how to go about this, for the king had never forced anyone to do
anything before.

Again, the guards were dispatched to the maiden's house though this time armed
with swords. Entering the house, they brandished their swords and demanded that
the maiden marry the king. The maiden looked up from her washing and said, "No".
Having no idea what to do next, the guards returned to the castle.

Ut now began to worry. It seemed they were dealing with more powerful creature
than he had first suspected. He began to fear for the king's life. He tried to
convince the king that maybe he should reconsider his desire to marry the
maiden and even suggested that his own niece had always been very fond of the
king.

The king went to bed that night feeling even worse than before. His dreams
knocked him about all night and finally tossed him awake in the wee hours of
the next morning. He immediately summoned his guards to take him to the
maiden's house.

Entering the maiden's house, looking disheveled and exhausted, and without
regard for the usual formalities of conversation he said to the maiden,
"Why won't you marry me?". The maiden looked up at the king and said,
"Because I don't want to marry you." and then by way of explanation, "I
generally only do things that I want to do." "So do I" exclaimed the king,
excited that they had finally found some common ground. "But that is just
the problem" said the maiden. "Our desires are incompatible." Incompatible,
the King said over in his head liking the sound of the word but not its
meaning. "But why should you get what you want?" asked the king. "It's not
fair" "Is it fair that you always get what you want?" asked the maiden.
"and what of the desires of the people of the kingdom? Do they ever get
what they want?" It was true that he had never considered the desires of
his people. In fact, he had never considered that they had desires.  "But
don't they just want what I want?" asked the king. "Maybe you should ask
them." said the maiden. "Oh" said the king, and then "Hmm" and then "Well"
and then after thanking her for her time, the king left to return to the
kingdom.

When the king returned his ministers were happy to find him alive and well.
He told them of his curious conversation with the maiden and asked them if
they thought that the people of the kingdom had desires? Well said Minister
Or. They might want this or that but never anything special. For example
said, Ut I overheard Mr. Brown complaining that his cow had died. He might
want a new one. 

of his new
desire to discover the desires of his people. The ministers all agreed that
this was a good and noble desire, but mostly they were happy for anything
that would turn his attention from the maiden.

The next day, the people of the kingdom were called into the royal
courtyard where the king could address them all at once and after a short
preamble he got straight to the point. "...and now you must tell me what
you want."

For a while no one spoke. Even those old enough to remember having their
own desires could hardly think of what to say. Finally, a young boy spoke
up and said, "I would like a pony" He made his request so quietly that the
king had to ask him to repeat it, but as soon as the king heard it, he
immediately sent a page to the royal stables to find a pony for the boy.
The next desire came from a man who had lost one of his hens recently.
Another page was sent to the royal hennery to find the man a replacement. 

And so for a while the statements of desire continued in an orderly
fashion. But as the day wore on, the people became less patient as they
watched their neighbors having their desires granted and began to long for
the granting of their own. People began to shout over each other, the mood
of the crowd darkened and the focus of the crowd's attention turned inward. 

Sensing danger, the king became alarmed and begged his minsiters to calm
the crowd. and his ministers were able to quiet the crowd.  The king gave
his guarantee that all desires would be met. But he said he had grown tired
and would have to resume the process first thing tomorrow.

The next day a more orderly process was established that involved lines and
numbers. But as the week wore on the granting of desires became more
difficult. The royal hennery and stables contained only so many hens and
horses. Some of the latest desires expressed by the people were no longer
so simple. Some neighbors began to use their desires merely as a means to
gain advantage over their fellow neighbors. And more and more the desire of
one person was incompatible with the desire of another.

By the end of week, fights were breaking out between neighbors and choas
had taken hold of the kingdom. Glass and Fire The future of the kingdom had
never looked so bleak. The king and his ministers no longer control the
people. It was chaos not king who ruled the people.  The king shouted, He
demanded, he sent the guards into to stop the fights but nothing worked.
Chaos not king now ruled the people. But before the kingdom fell into an
abyss something happened. The fighting stopped. Like a dog finally breaking
free of his leash the struggle no longer seemed to have any meaning.
Suddenly the felt that their fighting for had become fighting against. And
instead of demanding desires they demanded that the king return to the
past.

When the streets felt safe, the ministers ventured out to assess the
damage. They spoke with the people and it was generally agreed that all
would very much like to put this episode behind them and return the kingdom
to the familiar ways of the not so distance past. 

The ministers also agreed that this would be for the best of everyone and
returned to tell the king. "Yes, Yes." agreed the king also hoping to
quickly put behind him the disaster of the past couple of weeks.  And so
the ministers waited while he sat on his throne. As the waiting became
awkward, the king looked around and said, "Well what do you want me to do?"
Minister Or finally spoke up and said, "Well, we were waiting for you to
express a desire."  "Oh, right" said the king as if this had been obvious
to him as well.

And then everyone waited some more. The king furrowed his brow, rubbed his
chin, pursed his lips and generally expressed all the expressions of a
person working hard in thought. But try as he might, desire escaped him. No
matter how much he furrowed or rubbed or pursed he simply could not think
of anything he wanted. Where had all his desires gone he thought. Had he
simply used them up like a spendthrift exhausting his money. No one seemed
to know. His ministers tried to tempt him with offers of things that all
seemed tempting, but with no luck. There was nothing that the king wanted.

Suddenly the king did not know what to do. His whole life had been driven
by his desires and now he had none. A world once sharp in contrast now
seemed dull and drab. He cared no more for sitting or standing, for turkey
or chicken, nothing seemed to drive him and so he did nothing was what he
did.

The kingdom also did not know what to do. Most of their lives had been
dedicated to serving the desires of the king. The last two weeks of
following their own desires had led them frightenly close to anarchy and so
they were left having no external desires to drive them and afraid to even
contemplate any internal desires.

The ministers returned to their chambers. The people returned to their
home, but without the desires of the king to be granted or the desires of
their own. 

no one did much of anything else as the kingdom began to drift
aimlessly, the people fearful of the consequences of their desires and the
king impotent of his. No one seemed to want anything and so no one seemed
to do anything.  Broken glass remained broken and the smoldering fires
slowly exhausted themselves. People fullfilled their basic needs for food
and sleep, but not much else.

And as time wore the lethargy that infected the kingdom extended to the
things in the kingdom and beyond. Even the usual winds stopped blowing and
the clouds once swifth could barely make it across the sky. The depth of
bleakness in the kingdom seemed to know no bounds.

Then one morning when the maiden, who alone had exscaped the contagined,
rose from a fitful sleep noticed that the sun was not right or more
specifically not in its rightful place. As in the usual morning manner, it
peaked out from behind the earth but this morning it was on the going down
side instead of the coming up side. It appeared that on the previous
evening the sun had simply stopped on its way to bed possibly exhausted
from a long days work and having given up on its desire to move any
farther.

The morning or evening, for it was hard to say which, remined dark as dusk
and the maiden gave a sigh as she finally accepted that she relied on the
kingdom more than had wanted to admit. Her stock of flour was low and her
horse needed new shoes.

And so the maiden finally decided head into town to see what she could do
about the situation.

could do. She arrived to find a broken city. A city with no life blood. A
city that could do her no good. She needed to set things in place have
momentum drive the day.

The guards were no longer at their posts and she found the ministers laying
about. One pointed her to the king's chambers. 

She found the ministers mostly sleeping gaunt. She found the king who was
sat no more emotional, he alone seemed to be saddened by the situation but
could think of no remedy. The remediy is your desire said the maiden. But
it is gone said the king. The maiden had to agree that there seemed to be
nothing left. The king must have his breakfast. She agreed to set things
striaght, but he must play along. 

explained that the people wanted to follow the king, but the king could not
give them anything to follow.


"But what about me?"

asked the king. "What about you?" said the maiden. A moment of silence
ensued while the king considered his position. 


Entering the maiden's house, looking disheveled and exhausted, and without
regard for the usual formalities of conversation he said to the maiden,
"Why won't you marry me?". The maiden looked up at the king and said,
"Because I don't want to marry you." and then by way of explanation, "I
generally don't do things that I don't want to do." "But what about me?"
asked the king. "What about you?" said the maiden. A moment of silence
ensued while the king considered his position. 

Finally, the maiden proposed, "Why do you want to marry me?" "Because,
because..." said the king who had never been asked this sort of question
before and feeling exhausted from all of these new experiences.
"..because...I don't know." Because he really didn't know. "Well that is
not a very good reason." suggested the maiden. "I guess not" agreed the
king.  "Well, I think that settles it." said the maiden.  "Hmmm" was all
the king could say as he was lost in thought.

The king returned to the castle and sat back on his throne and stared out
at his chamber. The ministers asked him what he would like but he only
said, I don't care. The king did not care what he ate or when or what he
wore or when he went to bed. He stayed mostly in his bed and hardly did
anything at all. Without the demands of the king, his ministers were also
free to do what they wanted, but their wants were often at odds. At first
they all went about their business. One of the ministers wanted to
redecorate the hall, another was interested. Arguments even ensued over
when and what to have for dinner. This builds to war.

At this point Or decides to talk with the maiden. Can you help us? At this
point she agreed. It may have been her own frustration with the. She went
and talked with the king but he truely did not care.
 





"Will you marry me?" The maiden looked up from her sewing and said "No".
"But why" pleaded the king. "Because I don't love you" said the maiden. And
then more quitely, "But why". "I do not know." said the maiden, and then "I am sorry."

The kind stood. His focus moved to a point somewhere behind the maiden. He
blinked. Tears began to well behind his eyes that were never to emerge and
for a moment time moved on without motion or sound. Slowly he straightened
his crown, and slowly he smoothed his ruffled gown and slowly he turned to
leave.

And just before he left, the maiden asked "Why do you want to marry me?"
and the king turned and looked at her, but did not say anything, because he
had nothing to say and then turned and left.

at first he argued and then he cojoled and then he gave up

And so asked him questions untill all of his desires lay in a heap on the
floor like a pile of expired currency. 

He returned to the kingdom with no emotion leaving only an instinct to move
forward.  

And whims of desires no longer marched through his head.  

The king asked his guards to return him to the castle where he sat in his
throne and he sat and he thought. And he thought about 

And so the patterns of life, attrophed from years of disuse, began to
reassurt themselves, like weeds in pavement, but with nothing to temper
them they became fixed in place out of balance. 



And in an instant all his desire gave way to saddness
and all his spirit gave way to acceptance and so he
slept and so he woke. And so untempered the weight of
routine left the king, the kingdom and even the heavans
stuck in a never ending pattern like a record
perpetually skipping through the same song and so and
so.


 

And sadly he returned to the kingdom and sadly he went to bed that evening
and sadly he woke the next morning. And sadly the simple routines of life
continued and even the heavens comformed. 

He returned to his throne where he sat all day and in the evening he went
to bed. The next morning he rose

And then for a moment
the king seemed about to topple. The guards exchanged uncertain glances and
then holding the king by his shoulders, carried him out of the house. They
placed him in the carriage and returned him to the kingdom.

The king stood. His focus moved to a point somewhere behind the maiden. He
blinked. 

They placed the king on the throne and this is where he sat all day and the
next day as well until finally one evening he got himself up and went to
bed. In the morning he wok

And so he sat on his throne and he sat all day, and in the evening he got
himself up and went to bed and so in the morning he woke and so guided by
instinct and memory the kingdom repeated the common and recent patterns of
the days until by the end of the week when the last remaining bits of
momentum gave out and like a clock trying to wind against its spring time
jumped back and then repeated itself again and so the kingdom continued
ever after.





The king was placed in his throne where he sat for the whole day. His
ministers sat and watched him and they waited. What else was there to do.
Toward the end of the day they resorted to proding him with questions but
no advice was forthcoming.

At the end of the day they agreed to put him to bed. They next day they
woke him and feed him breakfast. 

The ministers made sure he was put to bed every evening and feed breakfast
every morning. Like bees without a queen the kingdom sucombed to the dull
weight of the ordinary. routines and habits learned as rote. they continued
on an way that did not intend success but merely (not survival)

Like bees without a queen following the last orders given until the end.

And with nothing left to push
back the dull weight of routine the kingdom fell into the dull and certain
patterns that marked their hours, days and weeks, and even the heavens felt
compelled by the dreary power of the to conform. And so the king and
kingdom continued ever after.
