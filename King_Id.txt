The Story of King Id 

To say that King Id was a man of habit would be an understatement. Every
morning he rose at six and ate breakfast at seven. Lunch was served at noon
with dinner following at five. By eight o'clock, he was in bed and fast sleep.
Only his dinner menu varied by the day of the week with fish on Monday, mutton
on Tuesday and so on.

All of his habits including his meetings with ministers, walks in the
garden and formal banquets were arranged to punctuate his days, weeks and
months at regular intervals. It was not only the king's habits, but the
habits of his entire kingdom that commenced in a mechanically predictable
pattern. At one o'clock each day you could expect to see the baker passing
the florist on his way to deliver a dozen pasteries to the castle, and the
florist inside his shop preparing bouquets for the evenings meal.

Even the heavens conformed to the unusual nature of the kingdom with the sun
crossing the horizon at exactly six each morning and passing below exactly 12
hours later. Rain fell on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons with partly cloudy
skies during the reminder of the week.

But the king, and so the kingdom, had not always been this way. King Id was the
only child of King Et and Queen An and they were always very good to their
little prince. Some might argue, too good. It was their desire that their son's
desires never go unmet. He ate what he liked and had meals when he wanted. He
had ponies and playmates and even won games when he wished.  Instead of
surprising the prince on his birthdays, the king and queen simply asked him what
he wanted and made sure he got it.

The prince was always happy as long as he got what he wanted, and he
always got what he wanted, so he was always happy.

It came to pass that the king and queen both died, but the kingdom had become
accustomed to granting the now young king's wishes and so the habit continued
with the patterns of the kingdom following the daily whims of the king. 

Then one afternoon young king Id, while riding in his coach, spied a maiden
tending to the flowers in the park. He had never seen her before, so knew that
she must be new to the kingdom. As he approached, she rose and wiped her brow.
She stood gazing past him and into her own thoughts.

As he watched her standing there, a desire stirred in him more powerful than he
had ever felt before. Without exchanging a single word, he decided that she
should be his queen and asked his ministers to make arrangements for his
marriage. Immediately a date was set and work begun to prepare for a royal
wedding. A young and trusted minister named Or was dispatched to find the young
maiden and inform her of the news. 

When Or found her, she was at her Aunt's house where she was living after
having moved from a neighboring kingdom. He informed her of the wedding, and as
he began to describe her role as the future queen something happened that had
never happened before. She said no.  He continued with his description barely
acknowledging her answer because it was to a question that he had not even
asked. When finally the minister realized something was wrong he stopped.  He
stood looking at her without knowing what to say.

Given that there seemed to be some confusion. The young maiden clarified her
feelings, saying, "I have no intention of marrying the king" Young Or opened
his mouth, but all that came out was "Ahh" and then when he had slightly
recovered "Yes...I will inform the king." The minister returned to the castle
fearing for his job if not for his very life and told the king his story.

The king listened to Or and did not say a word. He felt the painful sense of
desire that results from not getting what one deeply desires, and then he felt
fear. Suddenly, his world had stopped behaving in a way that it had always
behaved before. It was as if one day, the sun had one day simply decided not to
rise.

When Or finished his story, the king slowly got up from his chair and walked
into his chamber. He climbed into the royal bed and pulled the royal covers
over his royal head. 

Each of his ministers tried to appease him by bringing him things he had
desired in the past, but what he wanted was what he wanted, not what he had
wanted and the only thing he wanted was to marry the girl he saw in the park.

Finally Ut, his oldest and wised minister, was called in to help. "Ut, what
should I do", the king moaned from beneath the sheets. You should order her to
marry you, replied Ut. The king was silent for a moment and then peaked out at
Ut. "Order her to marry me. Yes, yes, of course" the king said. "And how should
we go about doing that?" he asked. For the king had never ordered anyone to do
anything before. Ut said that he would take care of the matter and sent two of
the kings guards off to the maiden's house.

After being shown in, the guards read the royal decree ordering the maiden
to marry the king. The maiden looked up from her mending and said, "I am
sorry but I won't." Not knowing what else to do, the guards returned to the
castle and relayed their news.

Minister Ut's voice betrayed some concern when he told the king the news, but
immediately suggested a new strategy. The king should force the maiden to marry
him. "Yes, yes, we must use force" the king responded but did not bother to ask
Ut about how to go about this, for the king had never forced anyone to do
anything before.

Again, the guards were dispatched to the maiden's house though this time armed
with swords. Entering the house, they brandished their swords and demanded that
the maiden marry the king. The maiden looked up from her washing and said, "No".
Having no idea what to do next, the guards returned to the castle.

Ut now began to worry. It seemed they were dealing with more powerful creature
than he had first suspected. He began to fear for the king's life. He tried to
convince the king that maybe he should reconsider his desire to marry the
maiden and even suggested that his own niece had always been very fond of the
king.

The king went to bed that night feeling even worse than before. His dreams
knocked him about all night and finally tossed him awake in the wee hours of
the next morning. He immediately summoned his guards to take him to the
maiden's house.

Entering the maiden's house, looking disheveled and exhausted, and without
regard for the usual formalities of conversation he said to the maiden,
"Will you marry me?" The maiden looked up from her sewing and said "No".
"But why" pleaded the king. "Because I don't love you" said the maiden. And
then more quitely, "But why". "I do not know." said the maiden, and then "I am sorry."

The kind stood. His focus moved to a point somewhere behind the maiden. He
blinked. Tears began to well behind his eyes that were never to emerge and
for a moment time moved on without motion or sound. Slowly he straightened
his crown, and slowly he smoothed his ruffled gown and slowly he turned and
left. 

The king asked his guards to return him to the castle where he sat in his
throne and he sat and he thought. And he thought about 

And so the patterns of life, attrophed from years of disuse, began to
reassurt themselves, like weeds in pavement, but with nothing to temper
them they became fixed in place out of balance. 



And in an instant all his desire gave way to saddness
and all his spirit gave way to acceptance and so he
slept and so he woke. And so untempered the weight of
routine left the king, the kingdom and even the heavans
stuck in a never ending pattern like a record
perpetually skipping through the same song and so and
so.


 

And sadly he returned to the kingdom and sadly he went to bed that evening
and sadly he woke the next morning. And sadly the simple routines of life
continued and even the heavens comformed. 

He returned to his throne where he sat all day and in the evening he went
to bed. The next morning he rose

And then for a moment
the king seemed about to topple. The guards exchanged uncertain glances and
then holding the king by his shoulders, carried him out of the house. They
placed him in the carriage and returned him to the kingdom.

The king stood. His focus moved to a point somewhere behind the maiden. He
blinked. 

They placed the king on the throne and this is where he sat all day and the
next day as well until finally one evening he got himself up and went to
bed. In the morning he wok

And so he sat on his throne and he sat all day, and in the evening he got
himself up and went to bed and so in the morning he woke and so guided by
instinct and memory the kingdom repeated the common and recent patterns of
the days until by the end of the week when the last remaining bits of
momentum gave out and like a clock trying to wind against its spring time
jumped back and then repeated itself again and so the kingdom continued
ever after.





The king was placed in his throne where he sat for the whole day. His
ministers sat and watched him and they waited. What else was there to do.
Toward the end of the day they resorted to proding him with questions but
no advice was forthcoming.

At the end of the day they agreed to put him to bed. They next day they
woke him and feed him breakfast. 

The ministers made sure he was put to bed every evening and feed breakfast
every morning. Like bees without a queen the kingdom sucombed to the dull
weight of the ordinary. routines and habits learned as rote. they continued
on an way that did not intend success but merely (not survival)

Like bees without a queen following the last orders given until the end.

And with nothing left to push
back the dull weight of routine the kingdom fell into the dull and certain
patterns that marked their hours, days and weeks, and even the heavens felt
compelled by the dreary power of the to conform. And so the king and
kingdom continued ever after.
