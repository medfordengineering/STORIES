"Hey, Peter's got a zombone. Are you texting?" asked
John. "I swear, it's the only way my parents will
communicate with me." "So then, what's the point?" said
Norm. "I just send my parents letters every once in a
while" he continued. "Do they write back?" asked John.
"God no, I don't think they even know how to write.
Besides, I don't think my Dad has actually looked up
from MineCraft for the past fifteen years." 

"So are we going to the rally or what" asked John.
"Your the one texting." "Okay, I'm done. Can we go?"
"Just don't bring that thing with you, or I am going to
pretend I don't know you." "And tuck your shirt in, and
where did you get that tie?" "God you are such a slob."

"Do you know where we're going?" "The address said, 649
Ellery St. I think I know where that is."
