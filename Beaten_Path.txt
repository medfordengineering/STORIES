 
It is on the beaten path I stay
I will not slip I will not stray
I will not fall I pray I pray
 
For off the path the lions wait
waiting for to steal my fate
Their hungry eyes I cannot see
but I know they wait for me
Their toothy grins imagine I
in sure and anxious wait they lie
 
And so in haste I make my way
and on I travel night and day
and where I go I wonder not
for safety is my only thought
and over hill and on round bend
until I finally find my end
