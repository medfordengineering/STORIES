"Fuck." Why did he always have to swear? Candice thought taking another
drag on her cigarette. "Fuck" he said again though this time louder. Here
they were a week from base station hooked up to some God forsaken hunk of
metal locked in geocentric orbit over some God forsaken sector of Martian
desert, probably a colony or science station of some sort, and all they knew is
that this satellite needed repair.

She watched him out in space banging around under the solar collectors,
swearing like some kind of idiot at the giant piece of hardware. His voice
sounded nasal over the interior speakers and xxit was mixed with the sound of
heavy breathing.

Candice just rested and watched him out the window. Maybe one day she would
not let him back inside, she thought, until he agreed to stop swearing. It
wasn't that she found swearing offensive, it just seemed so futile. She
took another drag on her cigarette. 

Smoking made her feel like she was home, Earth home. Not that she had been
there much and not that she really wanted to go back. It was just gave her
a sense of weight like gravity.

A few minutes later Charles came in through the hatch. He let out a sigh of
exasperation as took off his helmet. She handed him a towel to collect the
sweat that beaded on his face and hair. He looked over at her. "Could you
put that out?" he scowled. "Open a window." she laughed as she stubbed out
the cigarette. It was her ship after all, she could smoke if she wanted,
besides she had put in filters to handle it.

"Any luck?" she asked. "No. I was able to get a signal on the rotator, but
there is still no power on the condenser." he shook his head in
frustration. "I'll have to try again tomorrow."

"What did he care?" she thought. "It was not his satellite. But he always
cared. He always cared too much. And he would get it working. He always
did."  

It was the third week of a six week to trip to repair seven satellites all
in the inner solar system and it was her second year working with Carl.
Charles was satellite repair technician employed by HangSeng Industries.
Candice was an independent contractor who was presently employed by
HangSeng to ferry Charles. Technically, ships did not require human
operators, but sending people out into space alone was problematic. Not
that they cared what happened to him, it just always cost them more money.
There was also the problem of pirates or terrorist depending on your point
of view. Candice didn't like pirates but their existence meant job
security.

Candice opened a can of stew while Charles sipped coffee.
Hows the payload? Charles was referring to Dale a man paying for passage to
Mars Serenity station, there next stop. According to her contract, Candice
was prohibited from ferrying passengers or any freight while employed by
HangSeng, but it was a rule that no contract hauler obeyed. Working for
HangSeng meant a regular paycheck but it didn't pay enough. 

I haven't seen him since for the past twelve hours. He's probably still
drunk. I don't know how anyone can drink in low-g. Charles shook his head.
I would be vomiting. Oh, you get used to it. Candice had taken up smoking
to avoid drinking.

H:e started talking to the machine. It was a machine. It was logical
and yet it did behave that way, as if some lurking consciousness.  
She could fix ships and he could drive. It really made no difference.
You are not being rational. Why??? She knew that being out in space for
long had its effects. Maybe this was what was happening. 

Dale was baggage, just along for the ride.

Machines still broke down and it was the humans that were sent to fix them.

They repair ships. No one else will have jobs in space.
