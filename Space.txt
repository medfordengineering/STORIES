"Fuck." Why did he always have to swear? Candice thought taking another
drag on her cigarette. "Fuck" he said again though this time louder. Here
they were a week from base station hooked up to some God forsaken hunk of
metal locked in geocentric orbit over some God forsaken plot of Martian
territory, probably a colony or science station. All they knew is that this
satellite needed repair.

She watched him out in space banging around under the solar collectors,
swearing like some kind of idiot at the giant piece of hardware. His voice
sounded nasal over the interior speakers and it was mixed with the sound of
heavy breathing.

Candice just sat and watched him out the window. Maybe one day she would
not let him back inside, she thought, until he agreed to stop swearing. It
wasn't that she found it offensive, it just seemed so futile. She took
another drag on her cigarette. 

Smoking made her feel like she was home, Earth home. Not that she had been
there much and not that she really wanted to go back. It was just gave her
a sense of gravity.

A few minutes later Charles came in through the hatch. He let out a sigh of
exasperation as took off his helmet. She handed him a towel to collect the
sweat that beaded on his face and hair. He looked over at her. "Could you
put that out?" he scowled. "Open a window." she laughed as she stubbed out
the cigarette. It was her ship after all, she could smoke if she wanted.

"Any luck?" she asked. "No. I was able to get a signal on the rotator, but
there is still no power on the condenser." he shook his head in
frustration. "I'll have to try again tomorrow."

"What did he care?" she thought. "It was not his satellite. But he always
cared. Always cared too much."  He started talking to the machine. It was a
machine. It was logical and yet it did behave that way, as if some lurking
consciousness.  She did not need to drive the ship. No one needed to drive
ships any more.  But they did not want to send one person out alone. Not
that they cared what happened to him expect if cost them money and people
sent out alone into space always cost them money.  

She could fix ships and he could drive. It really made no difference.
You are not being rational. Why??? She knew that being out in space for
long had its effects. Maybe this was what was happening. 

Dale was baggage, just along for the ride.

Machines still broke down and it was the humans that were sent to fix them.

They repair ships. No one else will have jobs in space.
