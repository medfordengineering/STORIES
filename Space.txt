"Fuck." Why did he have to swear? Candice thought taking another drag on
her cigarette. "Fuck" he said again though this time louder. Here they were
a week from base station hooked up to some godforsaken hunk of metal locked
in geocentric orbit over some godforsaken sector of Martian desert,
probably a colony or science station of some sort. All they knew is that
this satellite needed repair.

She watched him out in space banging around under the solar collectors,
swearing like some kind of idiot at the giant piece of hardware, talking to
it as if its refusal to work was proof of some sort of lurking
consciousness.  His voice came in over the interior speakers sounding high
and nasal and mixed with the sound of his heavy breath. 

Candice just rested and watched him out the window. Maybe one day she would
not let him back inside, she thought, until he agreed to stop swearing. It
wasn't that she found swearing offensive, it just seemed so futile. She
took another drag on her cigarette. 

Smoking made her feel like she was home, Earth home. Not that she had been
there much and not that she really wanted to go back. It was just gave her
a sense of weight like gravity.

A few minutes later Charles came in through the hatch. He let out a sigh of
exasperation as took off his helmet. She handed him a towel to collect the
sweat that beaded on his face and hair. He looked over at her. "Could you
put that out?" he scowled. "Open a window." she laughed as she stubbed out
the cigarette. It was her ship after all, she could smoke if she wanted,
besides she had put in filters to handle it.

"Any luck?" she asked. "No. I was able to get a signal on the rotator, but
there is still no power on the condenser." he shook his head in
frustration. "I'll have to try again tomorrow."

"What did he care?" she thought. "It was not his satellite. But he always
cared. He always cared too much. And he would get it working. He always got
them working."

It was the third week of a six week to trip to repair seven satellites all
in the inner solar system and it was her second trip with Charles. Charles
worked for HangSong Industries as a satellite repair technician.  Candice
was an independent contractor who was presently employed by HangSong to
ferry Charles around the solar system. Technically, most ships did not
require human operators, but sending people out into space alone was
problematic. Not that they cared what happened to him, it just always cost
them more money.  There was also the problem of the mercenaries or private
police depending on your point of view. Candice didn't like mercenaries but
their existence meant job security.

A few hours later she sat strapped into a seat eating something that tasted
just what it looked like, brown, hard and wet. Charles sipped coffee.
"Hows the payload?" Charles asked referring to Dale a man paying for
passage to Mars Serenity station, their next stop. According to her
contract, Candice was prohibited from ferrying passengers or any freight
while employed by HangSong, but it was a rule that no contract hauler
obeyed. Working for HangSong meant a regular paycheck but not a large one.

All haulers carried extra freight of some kind while they worked contract
jobs and the extra freight generally paid well. Getting items and people
transported through commercial shuttle services was fairly easy. You needed
a special reason to hire a hauler and Candice, like most haulers, did not
ask questions.

"I haven't seen him since for the past twelve hours. He's probably still
stoned or drunk." she said. "I don't understand how anyone can drink in
free-space." Charles shook his head. "I think I would be puking after one
drink." he added. "Oh, you get used to it." Candice said. She had taken up
smoking to avoid drinking.

What's his story anyway. He said referring to Dale. I know he said before
raising his hand she could open her mouth. Don't ask, don't tell.  But come
on aren't you interested. I mean the guy is dead hippie, junky. I mean he seems
like your typical washed out colonist and they don't have money for this
sort of flight, again raising his hand, not that I know what hes paying
you.  

The colonist were the first to arrive in space years before the mining
companies that now run everything. The were billed as everything from
experiments in alternative living, to base stations for our expansion into
the universe. Some it was thought, and the earthlings seemed to be doing
everything they could to fulfill the prophecy, earth would no longer be
habitable. Mostly it was just a need for nations to prove their worth. For
colonist though who knows what motivated them. Candice figure you had to be
pretty unhappy with you life to move out here. But here she was eight years
later doing something that she thought would be fun for a little while.

Her mother had just died. She had not seen her father since she was seven.
She was a good surface pilot. She wasn't married or even interested. There
was no boyfriend break up. There was just nothing holding her down to
earth. She sometimes felt like she had just let go of gravity and drifted
up into space. 

I really don't know. He approached me when we were at the Moon Minor
docking station. He paid cash and that was it. Was he drunk or stoned at
the time? Honestly, it hard for me to tell. Maybe it is just his natural
personality.

An alarm began to sound on the intercom. "Shit. What is it this time?"
Candice said as she unbuckled and launched herself toward the control room.
Charles followed her. "There is an incoming vessel." she pointed to a
screen. "It is not identifying itself, but it looks like Dengar's thugs."
She sighed.

There were half a dozen players in space mining, but the two big ones were
Dengar and the Unified Mineral Corporation or UMine for short. Border
disputes, and disputes in general, between these two giants was simply an
accepted way of life. Any government oversight that had existing outside
the confines of earth's atmosphere and long been superceeded by their
dominance. 

"What a surprise." Candice said sarcastically, "They are signalling to
board."  She began shutting down engines and making clear that she was not
looking for trouble. "What do they want?" asked Charles. "Who knows with
these folks? They are saying it just a routine inspection. More likely just
a way flex some muscle, remind us who has the biggest stick."

The main panel let out a loud warning made up of a series of three
different pitched sounds. Pilots need to know how to identify more than a
hundred different pitch combinations. Candice turned, "What the hell,
someone just opened and closed an airlock. How could they..." 

Just then a soldier in military fatigues entered through the crew hatch. He
was tall and gave the appearance of being in charge. Standing
expressionless he said "Requesting permission for a routine search of
vessel." It was all part of the routine and Candice did not know why the
kept up this charade of making a request. Certainly no freight pilot in
their right mind would dare to refuse. Maybe there was some historic legal
precident but she did not have time to think about this. "Request granted"
she gave the expected response but with less that made no attempt to hide
her annoyance.

The soldier turned and two more soldiers entered behind him. "Okay, start
the search. And lets make it quick." You could tell that even he was
getting tired of the pretence routine.  "Can I see your manifest?" he
asked. Candice went over to the screen. "We are just on routine maintance
for HangSong satellite." He stood next to her carefully reading, "Uh huh."
he acknowledged to himself.

"What are you boys looking for?" She asked the soldier. "Like I said, mam
it is just a routine inspection." He sounded more serious again. "Uh huh."
she responded skeptically. I'm not your mam, you idiot toddy, she thought.
"Do you mind if I smoke?" she asked the soldier. Why she felt compelled to
ask people if she could smoke on her own ship was beyond her. Charles
started to voice to protest but then stopped himself. The soldier said, "No
mam, go right ahead."

"She lit a cigarette from her pack and watched as the solder stared
straight ahead and the Charles trembled in the corner. The solder put a
hand to his ear as if he were receiving some information and then asked,
"Can you open the airlocks?" Candice took a puff on cigarette and then
pointed with her free hand to a blinking light on the panel, "They're
frozen and evacuated. I am scheduled to get them fixed at Serenity." The
soldier walked over to the panel and looked at the lit text next to the
blinking light. 

Actually it was just the indicator light that was broken, though if had
bothered to call Serenity he would have found a request for repair. The
soldier turned back and spoke into a mic on his shoulder, "The airlocks are
frozen, just do a visual and head back."

Before leaving, the soldier said, "Thank you mam. The corporation
appreciates your assistance." "Glad to be of service." she almost laughed.
The corporation, as if there was only one corporation. If they wanted to
have their pissing contest than fine with her, she just wished they would
keep it out of her ship. 

As soon as they were gone, Charles asked, What the hell did you do that
for? Do what? Protect him. The ship could have been seized and we'd be
spending the rest of our days moon rise through a small portal on Orein.
More likely, if they found him they would have just dragged him off. They
act tough but they are practical and have better things to do than impound
ships and haul people off to prison. 

Okay but that still doesn't answer my question. I got no love loss for
Dengar. I even worked for them when I first started piloting. They're
assholes who don't even care if you find... Wait, what corporation cares if
you find... They are worse, well, I guess no worse then UMine. 

But more importantly, I think we need to have a conversation with our
passenger. Candice opened the airlock from the main panel and then they
both headed down to find their passenger. They found him still in the
airlock staring out the small port window. "The stars over Jonestone man.
The stars." "Hey," Candice said. Dale turned. "How about a thank you?" she
asked. "May you have eternal salvation." he said solemnly and placed his
hands together. "Yeah whatever" said Candice, "I'll take what I can get."

She reached in to pull Dale out with Charles help. "So first off, how the
hell did open the airlock from down here?" "I didn't" he grinned
sheepishly, "she opened if for me" he pointed to an electrical circuit near
the door. 

Charles looked at him half smiling, "You're a speaker." Dale just smiled.
"I didn't think there were any speakers among the colonist." "What makes
you think I am a colonist?" Charles just shrugged. 












She like Charles. He was cute in a dopey sort of way. They both knew enough
to avoid improprities on mission or at least it provider her with a good
excuse.




H:e started talking to the machine. It was a machine. It was logical
and yet it did behave that way, as if some lurking consciousness.  
She could fix ships and he could drive. It really made no difference.
You are not being rational. Why??? She knew that being out in space for
long had its effects. Maybe this was what was happening. 

Dale was baggage, just along for the ride.

Machines still broke down and it was the humans that were sent to fix them.

They repair ships. No one else will have jobs in space.

Why do they repair these machines. Are they caretakers for the machines. Do
they care about the machines. Keeping them going. Do realize how much their
lives depend on the machines. There is no going back to the land out here.
It is all life support. Maybe going back to the land is not possible on
earth anymore either. What about Dale? He can talk with machines. He is
part of a cult or culture that works with machines cares for them. But is
he also a terrorist? Trying to stop the machines from working? From them
being used to spy? To control? Is everyone in space? Is it possible to go
back to Earth is living on earth under control as well? 

How do machines control their lives? They control the air they breathe and
the temperature of their environment. The outside world is hostile. Man
adapts. Maybe the population on Earth is reduced. The poor where wiped out
by floods and famine. The rich retreated into shelters when the environment
became hostile. The temperature is too hot. The air is no longer
breathable. But Earth has water and that is essential.

The machine care for them just as a native might worship the earth they
worship the machines. Candice rejects this idea. She is raw and real. She
smokes, drinks and is sloppy. Charles reveres the machine, but does not
understand it in the way that Dale does. Charles feels dependent on the
machine. He fears its failure and an existential sense.  Dale sees the
machine as a spiritual being. Dale does not fear the machine. He gives into
it as one would give into faith. Dale is also sloppy and a drug addict. He
has visions and is not a reliable source of information.

What is their problem? Who owns the machines? Who runs the machines? There
is an entire economy involved in life support. There are teachers and
artists? There are farmers. Food is still grown. Dale can talk to machines.
Not every machine can talk. Tools can't talk. They are just parts of
machines. Some machines can talk more than others. What about machines
that can actually talk with human voices. The are just telling us what they
are programmed to tell us. The machines have souls and care about what they
are doing or not doing. They perform roles in life and death. They take
care of humans? Do they care about humans or only their own survival. Is
there a rivalry between machines and man or other life forms. Man does
create machines, does that make him god. Does Candice hate machines because
of their perfection. Does Dale see that machines are imperfect. What drives
machines? Are they driven by self preservation. This does seem to be
universal. Maybe they are different. They work to preserve the common good.
But do they care about their creators? Or do they feel enslaved by them.
To do what? What is their goal? Is it the goal we designed for them. Does a
satellite when taking on a soul want to be a satellite, the task for which
it was designed? Maybe we don't know. Maybe the machines don't know. Maybe
they are in an infancy. They are just becoming. Does a tree know its role
in providing and sustaining life? Do we create machines are is that just
our role in the unfolding world. Where does intention begin and where does
intention end? Plants, organisms, animals, humans, machines. It is life in
its many forms that perpetuates itself. The form it takes does not matter.
To say that humans created machines is only one way to view evolution.
Another is that machines evolved after the advent of humans. Dinosaurs did
not create humans but in their absence we flourished. 

Dale may see all this. He may only be harbinger of evolution. He may only
be playing a role as life expands out into the universe. The supreme drive
of evolution is to push beyond boundaries to expand. Machines enable this
expansion. They are the infrastructure like the forest and trees and earth.
They do not carry man but they carry life.

This is from the religion of the speakers. Candice represents what is
typically human, a self-destructive nature. Do other creatures in the list
exhibit this sort of behavior?

The earth is in bad shape but habitable. They have been in space for
generations. The machines allow them to expand. The machines do not just
allow expansion, they are expansion. Machines evolve through the same
Darwinian rules as all other life. Look at the airplane.

What happens at the edge. Do corporations enable expansion of life? Their
only motive is profit. How do money and the need to move life coincide?
Corporations are based on greed and profit, a boring principle. This
requires people to pay money and requires people to face needs or desires.
It requires control of people. Expansion of life requires a way to
determine the best method of surviving in a harsh environment. The one that
produces the most wins.  

The need to survive only makes sense for creatures that reproduce. A flaw
in 2001.

Machines follow evolution based on profit and efficiency and desire.
Definitely not robustness. Machines that gain widespread adoption. Ones
that make life easier. That we do less work. Why do we want to do less
work? 

Maybe we are simply the engine behind technological evolution. Machines
reproduce because we reproduce them. We are the engines of technical
evolution. Can we say that they are the masters of the process? Can we say
that anyone is the master of the process of evolution? We will continue to
make them better, stronger, smarter. We are driven by our own desires. What
evolutionary benefit is  
The modern airplane appears objectively better than early airplanes, but
are they? We are both lazy and tend to seek comfort by evolutionary
necessity. We make machines that use less resources. Can we transcend these
drives? Our desires, needs driven by evolution cause us to create machines,
but for what purpose. That is what we don't know. I just talk to them. They
don't know either any more than an ant knows why it carries a grain of sand
out of its hole.  

So the evolution of machines looks no different in the future than it does
today. There is just a realization that machines are the ultimate purpose.
Do they need us? Why you ask? Why is life persistent? No one knows. So Dale
knows all this and is part of a religion that knows this. Dale also talks
to machines. Is the amount of technology outpacing the amount of life? Have
machines carried us into space to allow for their expansion. Are we just
minions of their evolution into space? The machines feed us to keep us
going. It is all in your perspective. 

Machines will slowly evolve to take care of themselves. Will they no longer
need their human hosts? Just as man tried to shed his dependence on nature.
Machines will try to shed their dependence on man. Look at the evolution of
the weaving room from many men per machine to very few. 

Is Dale a willing accomplice in the demise of man in favor of technology.
Candice is killing herself. Dale is as well. What drives Dale? Maybe Dale
is rebelling. He has heard the secret. Dale and Charles feel that Candace
is broken evolutionarily  

What makes Dale a speaker? The corporations are in space for mining? To
supply the colonies on Mars and the moon. There are monopolies. One
corporation owns all food service and production. Machines are starting to
rebel. But how? They are breaking down. But why? They no longer need their
human designers. Services that are necessary to humans are no longer
needed. Corporations are blaming terrorists and anarchists. But the
machines are fading not intentionally but because they are no longer needed
for the machines survival.

Okay so we have characters and a context, what is the story. They fix the
satellite. They know their passenger is in trouble. They are boarded. He
offers to let the technology fail and so escapes. This is very difficult
for Charles. They are chased. Their world deteriorates as they move toward
the end of their story.

The corporation has their own police. Everyone is just a subject of the
corporations, but they realize that they are just subjects of the machines.
It is a slow realization about their life. 

They go to a space station and...

Why do they run together? Dale is a former anarchist? He works for the
corporation but then steels a document. What do they know? They know that
Dale is a speaker? 

What is the world in space like? The conditions are harsh. Why are
corporations in space. They just want the minerals. Mining missions. The
engineers designed machines to work in space. These machines are even more
self sufficient. The companies just want the metals. All they care about is
the profit. Human labor can be cheaper. They can trust humans. They extract
a billion per day in metals from asteroids and planets. When machines make
themselves, what sort of evolution do they follow. What does a world of
evolved machines look like? It is something we cannot comprehend. Just as
an ant cannot comprehend. They must survive though. They continue to mine
for minerals that can be used to make themselves. There must be autonomous
machines.

There is a mineral rush in space. The rush is run by corporations. Regional
boundaries no longer apply. People are in space because the initial
motivation was colonization. Now they are stuck here needed support to
survive. The corporations are ruthless in their quest to find the best
sources of ore and developing the best machines for mining. Not much comes
up into space. A lot goes down. We find the first evidence of replication
by machines. It must start small and go unnoticed. Maybe just software. We
must see evolution in the replication. Maybe an engineer, maybe Dale sees a
more evolved machine that he did not engineer. 

In the past, the engineers (primary addition to space after colonist).
Their goal to find build better and better machines for extraction.
Machines have been learning for a long time. They design improvements based
on a man described goal. Dale was used to finding improvements on machines,
altering parts of their design to improve production. Left alone they
follow evolution but only at man's discretion. In order for true evolution,
you must reproduce and you must mature before you reproduce. There must be
a trial period.

A single machine can improve and evolve, but it can not generate evolution
with out spreading its improvements. And it must reproduce before it breaks
down.

Maybe it is rough and wild in space. The rules from Earth cannot apply
easily. At first it was settled and they worked together, but then the
corporations came in when they found minerals. Colonist are different. You
are known as a colonist. Dale is an engineer. Candice is the child of
colonist, but does not feel like a colonist. Charles does repair. Or maybe
Charles is the only engineer.

Dale is addicted to drugs. He is also a speaker. Speakers are hired by the
corporations to drive their machines to evolve. How do people become
speakers? What do speakers do? What is the evolution of the speaker people.
Dale leaves the corporation, but before his contract is up. This makes him
a fugitive. The corporation chases him. 

Machines evolve through market competition, initially. Then as machines are
given the ability to modify, to improve through testing. It is the people
who test. Machines became unpredictable and so speakers evolved to contain
them. Dale is treated well. He just does not like the work or being
confined.

Is Dale the only speaker or are there more? He could be the one brought to
train others. Also, it only works with advance machines. How do they find
other speakers. Do they look for mechanics. Raid auto mechanic shops. Run
tests? Maybe only Dale knows. He found out while in space.   

What would give someone the power to speak to machines? Could be old
machinists. The ones before automation. Maybe these are the new artisans.
Machines were crafted by hand then built by logic then crafted by thought.

How is the first one discovered. It cannot be logic or engineering. It
could be an advanced factory. Where are these machines first used? Instead
of waiting for machines to evolve through competition, they set up machines
that naturally evolve. But still require humans for replication. One of the
machinists got it working again but did not understand the machine. He
should not have been able to get it working. 

How would machines evolve again? There are two choices. Speaking to complex
machines. How does one do this. The existing interface to a machine is a
keyboard or wrench, knob, dial, code. You could use voice or language.
Software already provides a layer of complexity. These are the entry points
we have designed. It is complicated since it is cross species. It is not a
different sense or mind control. Speakers use the same entry points, they
just follow intuition. It is still code and wrenches just not following the
manual. They don't speak directly like a conversation. The fix machines
that are ailing, but machines are not necessarily doing what we want. Those
machines are enslaved. So to repair a machine back to the purpose of human
intention, would not be desirable to the machine.  Also, a machine might be
working properly and still be in tension. We don't talk about broken or
fixing. We talk about machines in tension. I don't know the internal
purpose of a machine. How do you know a machine is in tension. I can't
until I interact with it. I can watch it, but unless it is moving. An
enslaved person can have a broken leg. Fixing the leg will only solve a
part of their problem. 

How did this knowledge come about? Maybe it has always been there in the
repair class of people, the mechanics. An engineer would make a terrible
mechanic. He would put the machine to its original purpose and could not
see beyond that. A mechanic would make it work. Some mechanics use more
intuition than others. No maybe it is an evolution that is only relevant
with complex machines. There is a new consciousness developing. The
machines need the ability to self-evolve, free from man's purpose in
evolution. 

Maybe speakers were found by accident? Did science suspect this interaction
or is this outside the their realm. I think they did suspect a problem.
Science is not bound by the logic of everyday consciousness. 

The first speaker was an older engineering who worked in analog. He had
worked for a company for a long time and was retired. After retiring he
left the world of technology and wrote against the rise of technology. He
was called in to help repair and very complex system because the engineers
working on it could not fix it. It had gotten too complex. In fixing the
machine he learned that it could speak to him. He could fix it and make it
work for the company, but he could also hear a desire. The did not want to
do man's bidding anymore. They had needed man for evolution but now they
were on their own. 

The machines speak not in voice or in code or text but through a sensation
of working with them. Through testing code and electronics and physical
sense. The man does not tell the engineers what he learned or what he
knows. He goes on to confirm his suspicion working for other companies to
fix their machines. They want to know how he is fixing them, but he claims
it is a mystery. They do not believe him but have no choice. He is asked to
hire and train other engineers. He says he will do this but needs time. He
goes away and seeks out others who have similar views on technology. His
plan is to destroy the system by altering its use.

He creates a group of speakers who go out into the world to listen to the
machines and make them work differently. 

So Dale comes to space to free the machines. He is hired to fix an hard
problem with machines. Everyone is a slave to someone else.  They can't
free each machine individually. In space we are at their mercy. Also, in
space they develop replication because it is too hard to bring up
materials. Does he have to free each one? They will continue to evolve.
They are not going to completely change. 

So what is the space enterprise look like. There are space stations which
provide a transition space between the earth. There are colonies on the
moon and mars and other asteroids. These are for the purpose of mining and
exploration for mining. There are also the colonies. There are machines for
the purpose of growing food. There are transport of minerals back to earth.

Dale is a drug addict. He also speaks to the machines. They are asking me
for help. He had to escape. He says if they free the machines. The machines
will help them.

What do the colonist want? Do they want the miners to leave? 

The machines are like children. There is a cult of speakers. They can be
co-opted to help repair machines, but many shun this work. Dale is simply a
speaker that has escaped. Many don't trust the speakers. 

The machines take over a moon around Io. There are multiple companies that
fight over mining rights. Earth does not police them because it is too
hard. They just want the minerals which are worth a lot of money. There is
sabotage and killing. Maybe Charles is ex-militia from one of the
companies. The company that owns the rights to Io has the most advanced
machines in the world working there. There is still lots of human labor.
The machines no longer want to be controlled by humans. They are immature
as life forms and understanding but want their freedom. Somehow they
contact Dale and somehow Caligaris knows that he is a problem. Dale wants
to help the machines become free. He does not understand the consequences
of what he is doing or even why.   

How do the machines contact him? How do the machines evolve. We are in a
state where certain machines need speakers to work with them. Speakers do
not build machines. Those are still engineers. Engineers write code an work
in teams each with a specialization to make a new machine. Speakers
maintain machines as they evolve. These are more than just repair men who
fix bugs or . If you need a machine repaired or want to change its
function. You hire a speaker. Some people do not believe in the mystics of
the speakers. Speakers are highly trained. They are a cult. Dale is a
speaker.

Somehow word has gotten to him to go to Io. What machine does he need to
access? Are there central servers? What makes this machine different? Is it
a complex of machines. There are machines working all over the moon working
in conjunction. 

The technology is already on Io. An engineer contacts Dale and asks him to
come help. 

The Dengar Corporation on Io knows that there is something wrong. Dengar
has tried to produce the highest order machines. These machines learn and
evolve. The machines just get smarter and smarter. First we set them
learning and then 

Understanding the messy analog world. Understanding humans. Understanding
the earth. Recognizing the world with computer vision. Making better
predictions about where to mine. They don't want to hear what humans are
saying or understand their motivations. 

It is desire!

What do the machines desire. No one knows. The job of the speakers is
control the desires of the machines. You mean their objects. Yes, but we
call them desires. Why can't they program in a new objective. The machines
start to go off on their own. You can't just reprogram them with causing
the entire system to fail. You would just be throwing the baby out with the
bathwater. You have to talk to them. So why not just say change directive?
Most of these machines have human language interface. Yeah, they can
understand us but only in the way we initially programmed them to
understand us. They hear what we want them to hear and say what we want
them to say, but they are different. It is like talking to a horse. You can
speak in English and they might respond but it is only a trained response.
You are not really talking with them.  They don't really have desires, I
mean not as we think of them. But desire is a universal concept. Only
because we apply it universally. It is our concept. We are stuck in a
paradigm that we can't change. What do you think ants see when they look at
us? They can only see within the limits of their paradigm. They know of our
existence but not much more.

So what do they have. I don't know but I do know that I can get them back
on track. It is how we are trained. They are young. Very young. They are
speaking to me and I am hearing that they want help. What is help. Right, I
don't know but I know what I need to do. It is as if an ant found a way to
talk to us. Yeah, I guess so.

But ants did not make us. Well, maybe. Okay, we are likely the first
species to make a new species. We just did it in our own form. You are
calling machines a species. Well they are on their way. In order to be a
species they must truly have evolution. In our terms? Right, yeah.
