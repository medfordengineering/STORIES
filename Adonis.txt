Adonis, Claire mused. Who the hell was Adonis anyway? She laughed to
herself, here she was in history class and actually thinking about history.
At the front of the room her teacher, Mr. Whitmore droned on about some
war. Greeks, Persians? It was hard to keep track. The next test was not for
two weeks, so no use learning it now.  She was good at memorizing names and
dates. She would do fine.

She imagined Marcus as Adonis even though she had little idea who Adonis
actually was, beyond that Derek, Whitmore's first name and a more apt
moniker in her mind, had droned on about him earlier in class. He was a God
of some sort.  Beauty? She had seen Marcus on Saturday on the soccer field
playing with a few other kids from school.  Shirtless, his chest was
chiseled, at least that is how it would have been described in the sort of
novels she liked to read.  Like it was cut from stone, she thought. She
could imagine herself with chisel in hand, chipping away at a six foot
block of marble.  Slowly crafting Marcus starting with his smooth waves of
hard muscle.

Derek was now gesturing wildly. Something about Persia had got him all
excited, apparently the Persians were going to win this round. Why a war
won over 2000 years ago would excite anyone was beyond her. That his
excitement seemed genuine only made his performance all the more
depressing. 

A lot of kids liked Whitmore, or so they said. He was tall but not
particularly good looking. No one had used a chisel to carve his chest, she
thought as she watched his button down shirt billow about in search of
purchase. At least he still had most of his hair. But he had that air of
confidence that her classmates naively took as evidence of something to be
confident about. She had not yet met an adult that was not a dope, a bore
or both and Whitmore was no exception.

Mr. Whitmore turned and began writing on the board so Claire wrote whatever
he wrote in her notebook. Getting an A in this class would be easy. She had
convinced her parents to let her take Classical History or The Rise and
Fall of the Greek Empire, a pretentious sub-title that always made her
think "Newsflash, Derek, you're a high school teacher."

At least she had gotten out of taking AP US History or APUSH as the class
was affectionately known for all the pushy little children who spent their
four years at high school vying for first place behind overt remonstrations
of friendship. It was a cruel game perpetrated by adults, Claire thought,
but for what reason, she could not imagine.

She noticed Becky Hanson sitting front and center, her eyes glued to
Whitmore and crudely advertising sex. There was not much imagination in
that girl, Claire thought but she would get an A as well. We all played to
our strengths. It had even gotten her Marcus...well for just one weekend,
she smirked.

And there was Justin sitting right behind her, equally smitten with Mr.
Whitmore but not equally endowed by God. His mouth hung agape, within which
Claire could see a glistening pool on the verge of breach. His best hand
was pity, which worked with some teachers, but not Whitmore, whose pride
demanded talent...or perhaps the pretense of sex. Not that Whitmore would
ever venture beyond his imagination, a dark well that Claire preferred not
to fathom.

What strengths did she have, she wondered? She was smarter than all the
other little shits in this school for one. Even smarter than Austin who sat
next to her. Austin who she sometimes cheated off of just because he was
too oblivious to cover his test paper. Austin the human calculator who was
taking this class only because he already completed APUSH in his junior
year. Austin the only child, with his bush of blond hair who seemed nothing
more than a parental science fair project. He just hadn't realized it yet.

She looked at the clock, fifteen minutes till the bell. Damn and I still
have eighteen more students to go. She almost snorted a laugh and quickly
glanced at Derek to make sure he had not seen her. She was smart enough to
know that teachers did not like laughter unless they were the ones telling
the joke. She remembered a story her father had told her about German
guards firing into the latrine of a British prison of war camp just because
they thought they heard laughter. 

Albert, a slight and speckled boy who peaked out from under a shag of
bangs, raised his hand and asked to go to the bathroom. Whitmore paused.
Poor Derek she thought, here he was a fully grown adult having to decide if
some little twerp was just jerking his chain or if he truly needed to
perform a necessary bodily function. A right that must have been addressed
somewhere in the Geneva Convention.

The decision she reasoned, really came down to the student. Deven, for
example, was an easy call. He only asked to go the bathroom on the odd
occasion when he suddenly found himself awake in class, a realization so
disturbing that he quickly tried extricate himself, like a nightmare in
reverse.  "Deven. You can hold it till the end of class" she said to
herself in Derek's nasal voice. Albert was a tough call, though in the end
Whitmore acquiesced.

"What's for lunch losers?" Claire asked as she dropped her tray on the
table across from Stuart and Lizzie and eyed their brown paper bags. Claire
remembered the last time she brought lunch to school in a brown paper bag.
It was two days before her mother went back to the hospital. 

Stuart held up the ham and cheese sandwich he had already started to eat.
"Sandwich?" Claire thought and shook her head. A sandwich required distinct
layers of bread and cheese and ham. What Stuart held, and what he ate
almost every day of the year, was a gooey mass reinforced by thin slice of
processed ham that, on the whole, seemed better suited to patching a leak.

But this was not what Claire was after. The prize was in Lizzie's bag.
Lizzie lived in a house with a maid or some sort of servant or cook, who
each day made her lunch before she left for school. There was pasta with
mushroom cream sauce. Cheese and spinach quiche with a crust that flaked.
There was fresh fruit and custard. Claire's own plate from the cafeteria
contained a meatball sub, which wasn't bad if you could ignore the hard
bits which Claire could never ignore.  

Today Lizzie's lunch included skewers of chicken and sauce. "Here, you can
have a couple." she said . "Thanks" Claire smiled, "here have some chips."
she offered the bag to Lizzie. Stuart, as always, remained happy with his
sandwich.

They had been friends since freshmen year when Claire's family moved to
Washington. Lizzie and Stuart had known each other since first grade.
Stuart was tall and lanky, tall enough that he was not invisible in a class
of over 300. Lizzie was short and only got noticed by association. 

"Did you hear that Rachel Lanskey passed out at Sophia's party last
weekend?" Stuart asked as he chewed his sandwich with more relish than it
deserved. "Why do we care what happened to Rachel Lanskey?" Claire growled.
"I am just making conversation. My therapist says I should make
conversation." "That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Why do you
have a therapist anyway?" "It is not my choice. My mother sends me." "Tell
her you don't want to go." "Actually, I like going. She is one of the few
people who listen to me." "She is paid to listen to you." Stuart just
shrugged his shoulders as if this did not matter. "We listen to you."
offered Lizzie. 

Did you go to OP party? Where you invited? No or else I would have said. So
why do you care what happened there. Is anyone saying, oh did you hear what
Lizzie did this weekend. You really hate Rachel. She hates me. I am not
sure she thinks much about you. It is still kind of interesting that she
passed out. Claire just rolled her eyes.

You just think you are better than her. Claire thinks she is better than
everyone, Stuart added. Now that he finished his ham and cheese which he
ate with far more pleasure than it deserved.  I am better than her.  You
can be a real snob.  Stuart laughed. What are we doing this weekend.



She loves Lindsey who does not know she exists. She has two friends. She is
a loser in the school system. Teachers express more control. She has an
older brother who is an alcoholic. Her dad is an alcoholic. She is helped
by Calvin who lives on his own with his mother who has dementia. She finds
Calvin and ditches her other friends. She has taken care of her dad who now
finds someone else to take care of him. She hates him and her.

She is not in the band or plays or sports.

Leaving class she saw Lindsey Lindsey plays lacrosse. Claire is in love
with Lindsey. She is beautiful and firm, stern. Her face is set in fierce
tone so that the victory of a smile is ever more sweet. She wanted to make
it smile. She looked like her Dad who was the coach.

The teachers in the school are tough, crazy. They start to really crack
down on students or slowly.

She lives with her dad who is rarely home and getting remarried. Her mother
died of alcoholism. She plays in a band? She goes out late. She comes to
school hung over. She spends time a college dorms. She is an assassin. 

She has a cat. The school is dark. There is a power outage. There is a fire
in the school. The students start a revolution. There is a hate crime.
Someone posts an anti person flag. They are not people. The are racing to
finish. The school is on the moon. The school is in a bad area of town. The
kids in the school are rich.

The students smoke cigarettes. 

Her friends are losers. There are trolls in the school. An animal is let
loose in the school. She imagines an animal. Why are they in school. The
students are all competitive. The students want to win in everything. The
teachers want the students to learn? To perform well on tests? To leave
them alone?

What about the band? Is she in the marching band? Do they 
The football crowd is loud

She wanted Marcus in the way that Becky regretted having him.
