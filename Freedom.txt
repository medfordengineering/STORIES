The man at the podium raised his arm and shouted, Freedom, Freedom,
Freedom and the crowd cheered wildly. The man's name was Andrew Knox.
He used to be known as Professor Knox, but he dropped the title of
professor about a year ago, most likely at the suggestion of his
handlers. Knox was not dumb, but it was the kind of thing his handlers
would have though of before he did. 

Knox had left the podium and was shaking hands with people in the
crowd. These were all supporters. Gone were the days when people come
out just to learn more about a politician. The crowd had by now
consumed him.

Jake stood at the edge of the crowd. He was a reporter. He was there
because it was his job to be there.
